<p class="calibre22">In the 1950s, when I began the practice of psychotherapy, I became convinced that low self-esteem was a common denominator in all the varieties of personal distress I encountered in my practice. I saw low self-esteem as a predisposing causal factor of psychological problems and also a consequence. The relationship was reciprocal. As I said in the Introduction, this was the realization that ignited my fascination with the subject.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes problems could be understood as direct expressions of an underdeveloped self-esteem—for example, shyness, timidity, and fear of self-assertion or intimacy. Sometimes problems could be understood as consequences of the <em class="calibre23">denial</em> of poor self-esteem, that is, as defenses built against the reality of the problem—for example, controlling and manipulative behavior, obsessive-compulsive rituals, inappropriate aggressiveness, fear-driven sexuality, destructive forms of ambition—all aiming to produce some experience of efficacy, control, and personal worth. It seemed clear that problems that were manifestations of poor self-esteem were also contributors to the continuing deterioration of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Consequently, it was my view from the beginning that a primary task of psychotherapy is to help build self-esteem. This was not the perspective of my colleagues. Self-esteem was rarely considered at all, and insofar as it was, the traditional assumption was (and is) that self-esteem will benefit indirectly and implicitly, as a by-product of psychotherapy: <a></a>as other problems are solved, the client will naturally feel better about him- or herself. It is true that when anxiety and depression are diminished, the client feels stronger. It is also true that developing self-esteem diminishes anxiety and depression. I thought that self-esteem can and should be addressed explicitly; that it should set the context of the entire therapeutic enterprise; and that even when one is not working on it as such, even when one is focused instead on solving specific problems, one can do so by framing or contextualizing the process in such a way as to make it explicitly self-esteem strengthening. For example, almost all schools of therapy help clients to confront previously avoided conflicts or challenges. But I typically ask, “How do you <em class="calibre23">feel about yourself</em> when you avoid an issue you know, at some level, needs to be dealt with? And how do you feel about yourself when you master your avoidance impulses and confront the threatening issue?” I frame the process in terms of its consequences for self-esteem. I want clients to notice how their choices and actions affect their experience of themselves. I see this awareness as a powerful motivator for growth; it often helps in managing and transcending fear.</p>

<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">My purpose in this chapter is not to discuss the technique of psychotherapy as such, but merely to offer a few general observations about building self-esteem in a psychotherapeutic context and to suggest something of my approach. This chapter is addressed not only to the clinician or to students of therapy but to anyone thinking about therapy who would like to understand the self-esteem orientation as a frame of reference.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Goals of Psychotherapy</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Psychotherapy has two basic goals. One is the alleviation of suffering. The other is the facilitation and enhancement of well-being. While the two projects overlap, they are not the same. To reduce or eliminate anxiety is not equivalent to generating self-esteem, although it can contribute to that end. To reduce or eliminate depression is not <a></a>equivalent to generating happiness, although, again, it can contribute to that end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the one hand, psychotherapy aims to reduce irrational fears, depressive reactions, and troublesome feelings of every kind (perhaps from past traumatic experiences). On the other hand, it encourages the learning of new skills, new ways of thinking about and looking at life, better strategies for dealing with self and others, and an expanded sense of one’s possibilities. I place both these goals in the context of aiming to strengthen self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Raising self-esteem is more than a matter of eliminating negatives; it requires the attainment of positives. It requires a higher level of consciousness in the way one functions. It requires greater self-responsibility and integrity. It requires the willingness to move through fear to confront conflicts and discomfiting realities. It requires learning to face and master rather than withdraw and avoid.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Raising self-esteem is more than a matter of eliminating negatives; it requires the attainment of positives</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If someone enters therapy and at the end of the process does not live more consciously than at the beginning, the work has failed. If in the course of treatment the client does not grow in self-acceptance, self-responsibility, and all the other practices that support self-esteem, we would also have to question the therapeutic experience. Regardless of school, any effective therapy promotes growth along these dimensions, at least to some extent. But if a therapist understands the importance of the six practices and cultivates them as a conscious project, he or she is more likely to produce consistent results. He or she is challenged to develop means—cognitive, behavioral, experiential—that will promote self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If one therapeutic goal is to encourage a higher level of consciousness in the client, so that the client lives more mindfully and with better reality contact, then through conversation, psychological exercises and processes, body and energy work, and homework assignments, one can work at removing blocks to awareness, on the one hand, and stimulate and energize higher consciousness, on the other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another goal is to inspire greater self-acceptance, then one can create a climate of acceptance in the office, lead the client to identify and <a></a>reown blocked and disowned parts of the self, and teach the importance of being in a nonadversarial relationship to oneself and its parts (see my discussion of subpersonalities below).</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another goal is to strengthen self-responsibility, then one can frustrate the client’s maneuvers to transfer responsibility to the therapist, facilitate through exercises the client’s appreciation of the rewards of self-responsibility, and convey by every means possible that no one is coming to the rescue and that each of us is responsible for our choices and actions and for the attainment of our desires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another goal is to encourage self-assertiveness, then one can create an environment in which self-assertion will be safe, teach self-assertion through exercises such as sentence-completion, psychodrama, role-playing, and the like—work to defuse or neutralize fears of self-assertiveness—and actively encourage the client in facing and dealing with threatening conflicts and challenges.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another goal is to support living purposefully, then one can convey the role and importance of purpose in life, assist in the client’s clarification and articulation of goals, explore action plans, strategies, and tactics and their necessity for goal attainment, and work to awaken the client to the rewards of a life that is proactive and purposeful rather than reactive and passive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If another goal is to encourage personal integrity, then one needs to focus on values clarification, inner moral confusions and conflicts, the importance of choosing values that in fact do support one’s life and well-being, the benefits of living congruently with one’s convictions, and the pain of self-betrayal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shall not elaborate further on these points. I mention them primarily to suggest <em class="calibre23">a way of thinking</em> about psychotherapy when the cultivation of self-esteem is a central goal.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Climate of Therapy</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As with parents and teachers, an unrelenting attitude of acceptance and respect is perhaps the first way in which a psychotherapist can contribute to the self-esteem of a client. It is the foundation of useful therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This attitude is conveyed in how we greet clients when they arrive in the office, how we look at them, how we talk, and how we listen. This entails such matters as courtesy, eye contact, being noncondescending <a></a>and nonmoralistic, listening attentively, being concerned with understanding and with being understood, being appropriately spontaneous, refusing to be cast in the role of omniscient authority, and refusing to believe the client is incapable of growth. The respect is unrelenting, whatever the client’s behavior. The message is conveyed: A human being is an entity deserving respect; <em class="calibre23">you</em> are an entity deserving respect. A client, for whom being treated in this manner may be a rare or even unique experience, may be stimulated over time to begin to restructure his or her self-concept. Carl Rogers made acceptance and respect the core of his approach to therapy, so powerful did he understand its impact to be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall a client once saying to me, “Looking back over our therapy, I feel that nothing else that happened was quite so impactful as the simple fact that I always felt respected by you. I pulled everything I could to make you despise me and throw me out. I kept trying to make you act like my father. You refused to cooperate. Somehow, I had to deal with that, I had to let that in, which was difficult at first, but as I did the therapy began to take hold.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A therapist is not a cheerleader</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When a client is describing feelings of fear, or pain, or anger, it is not helpful to respond with, “Oh, you shouldn’t feel that!” A therapist is not a cheerleader. There is value in expressing feelings without having to deal with criticism, condemnation, sarcasm, distracting questions, or lectures. The process of expression is often intrinsically healing. A therapist who is uncomfortable with strong feelings needs to work on him- or herself. To be able to listen serenely and with empathy is basic to the healing arts. (It is also basic to authentic friendship, to say nothing of love.) When the client’s need for emotional expression has been met, then it sometimes can be useful to invite him or her to explore feelings more deeply and examine underlying assumptions that may need to be questioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One can subscribe to the merit of acceptance and respect in the abstract, but its implementation, even among well-intentioned therapists, is not always obvious. I am not thinking primarily of such obvious mistakes as resorting to sarcasm, moral condemnation, or other demeaning behavior. I am thinking of the subtler forms of authoritativeness, one-upmanship, “You’re doomed without my guidance,” and so forth, that <a></a>put the client in an inferior position and hint at the therapist’s omniscience. Psychoanalysis, which took its model from the traditional physician-patient relationship, may be especially vulnerable to this error, but the error can show up in any school of therapy. The error may have less to do with the theoretical orientation of the therapist than with his or her ability to manage personal needs for appreciation and admiration. I like to tell students, “The goal is not to prove that you are brilliant. The goal is to assist clients to discover that <em class="calibre23">they</em> are brilliant.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is one of the reasons I favor experiential learning over explicit teaching (without denying that sometimes explicit teaching can be appropriate). In experiential learning, which often entails the use of psychological exercises, processes, homework assignments, and the like, the client <em class="calibre23">discovers</em> relevant realities rather than hears about them from an authority. Autonomy is strengthened in the very nature of the learning process.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Uncovering the “Bright” Side</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Most people who seek psychotherapy have as one of their basic goals self-understanding. They want to feel visible to their therapist and they want to gain clearer visibility to themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To many people—and here the influence of traditional psychoanalysis is profound—self-understanding is primarily associated with the uncovering of dark secrets. Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, said somewhere that the difference between psychoanalysis and detective work is that, for the detective, the crime is known and the challenge is to discover the identity of the criminal, whereas to the psychoanalyst, the criminal is known and the challenge is to discover the crime. Even if one takes this as a bit of poetry not to be taken literally, it has rather unpleasant implications. Many clinicians who are not necessarily psychoanalysts share this mind-set. Their professional pride is centered on their ability to lead the client to confront “the dark side” (in Jungian terminology, “the Shadow”) and to integrate rather than disown it. This can be a necessary and important project, to be sure. However, a self-esteem-oriented therapy has different priorities—a different emphasis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no need less recognized in most people than the need to contact their unidentified (and possibly disowned) <em class="calibre23">resources</em>. This is the need to understand the strengths they do not know they possess, the potentials they have never explored, the capacity for self-healing and <a></a>self-development they have never summoned. A fundamental distinction among therapists, whatever their theoretical orientation, is whether they think of their task primarily in terms of uncovering assets or shortcomings, virtues or flaws, deficits or resources. Self-esteem-oriented psychotherapy focuses on positives—on the uncovering and activating of strengths—as the highest priority. It deals with negatives of necessity but always in the context of the positive focus and emphasis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone who has any familiarity with psychology knows about the danger of disowning the murderer within. Far fewer people understand the tragedy of disowning the hero within. In psychotherapy, it is often easy enough to see the part of the individual that is neurotic. The challenge is to see—and mobilize—that part that is healthy.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Everyone who has any familiarity with psychology knows about the danger of disowning the murderer within.

<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes we are simply ignorant of our positive resources. We do not recognize all we are capable of. Sometimes, however, we repress our knowledge. I remember working many years ago with a young woman in a therapy group. She was quite comfortable saying the most outrageously negative (and unjust) things about herself. I asked her, as an experiment, to stand facing the group and say aloud, repeatedly, “The truth is, I’m actually highly intelligent.” Her voice choked and at first she could not do it. Then I helped her to say it—and she began to weep. So I gave her the sentence stem: <strong class="calibre6">The bad thing about admitting my intelligence is</strong>—. Here were her first endings:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      My family will hate me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      No one in my family is supposed to have a mind.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      My sisters and brothers will be jealous.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I won’t belong anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      <em class="calibre23">I’ll have to take responsibility for my life</em>.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Then I gave her the stem: <strong class="calibre6">If I were to bring my intelligence to bear on my problems</strong>—. Her endings included:</p>
<a></a><div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      I would know that I’m already responsible for my life whether I admit it or not.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would see that I’m living in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would know that I’m not a little girl anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would see that it’s the little girl who’s scared, not me the adult.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would take possession of my life.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Then I gave her the stem: <strong class="calibre6">The frightening thing about admitting my strengths is</strong>—. Her endings included:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      No one would feel sorry for me [<em class="calibre23">laughing</em>].</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d move into unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d have to take a fresh look at my boyfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d know nothing is holding me back but me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I might be alone.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d have to learn a new way of living.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Suppose people put expectations on me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d have to learn to assert myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      It doesn’t feel frightening right now!</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">There are any number of ways skillful therapists put clients in touch with their positive resources, and it is not necessary to explore them here. What is important here is only the basic issue: Is the therapist <em class="calibre23">primarily</em> oriented to liabilities or assets? (One cannot always take a therapist’s word for it, either, since behavior often differs from professed belief.) One of the secrets of Virginia Satir’s great gifts as a family therapist was her conviction that people possessed all the resources they needed to solve their problems, and her ability to transmit that conviction to the people with whom she worked. In terms of producing results, it is one of the most important abilities a psychotherapist can possess.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Survival Strategies</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Clients need to understand that humans are, by nature, problem solvers. The solutions we produce, in response to the difficulties and challenges we encounter, aim consciously or subconsciously at filling <a></a>our needs. Sometimes the means we adopt are impractical and even self-destructive—“neurotic”—but at some level our intention is to take care of ourselves. Even suicide can be understood as a tragic effort at self-care, perhaps escape from intolerable suffering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we are young we may disown and repress feelings and emotions that evoke the disapproval of significant others and shake our own equilibrium, and we pay a price in later years in self-alienation, distorted perceptions, and any number of possible symptoms. Yet seen from the perspective of the child, the repression has functional utility; it has survival value; its intention is to make the child able to live more successfully—or at least to minimize pain. Or again, when we are young we may experience a good deal of hurt and rejection and develop a policy, in “self-protection,” to reject others first. This policy does not make for a happy life. And yet its intention is not to cause suffering but to reduce it. Survival strategies that do not serve our interests but in fact hurt us, but to which we nonetheless cling like life preservers in a stormy sea, are the ones psychologists label “neurotic.” The ones that serve our interests we properly label “good adaptations”—such as learning to walk, speak, think, and earn a living.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clients can be deeply ashamed of some of their dysfunctional responses to life’s challenges. They do not look at their behavior from the perspective of its intended functional utility. They are aware of their timidity or overaggressiveness or avoidance of human intimacy or compulsive sexuality, but not of its roots. They are not in contact with the needs they are blindly trying to address. Their shame and guilt do not make it easier for them to improve their condition, but harder. So one of the ways we can support self-esteem is by educating clients in the idea of survival strategies, helping them see that their worst mistakes can be understood as misguided attempts at self-preservation. Feelings of self-condemnation need to be examined and understood, but after this has been accomplished, their continued existence serves no useful purpose. When they are diminished the client is freer to consider solutions that can better fill their needs. “If it’s your own perception that what you do doesn’t work, are you willing to look at alternatives you might find more satisfying? Are you willing to experiment with trying something else?”</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Integrating Subpersonalities</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">On a technical level perhaps the two methods that most distinguish my approach are the use of sentence completions, which I have illustrated throughout this book as well as in several of my previous books, and working with subpersonalities, which I turn to now.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_043.html#filepos922019" id="filepos749226"><sup class="calibre39">*</sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">In my discussion of the second pillar of self-esteem, the practice of self-acceptance, I talked about accepting “all the parts” of ourselves, and I mentioned thoughts, emotions, actions, and memories. Yet our “parts” include actual subselves with values, perspectives, and feelings distinctively their own. I am not speaking of “multiple personalities,” in the pathological sense. I am speaking of normal constituents of a human psyche, of which most people are unaware. When a psychotherapist wishes to assist in the development of healthy self-esteem, an understanding of the dynamics of subpersonalities is an invaluable tool. This is territory that an individual is not likely to discover on his or her own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The idea of subpersonalities is almost as old as psychology itself, and some version of it may be found in any number of writers. It expresses the understanding that a monolithic view of the self, in which each individual has one personality and one personality only, with one set of values, perceptions, and responses, is an oversimplification of human reality. But beyond that generalization, there are great differences in how psychologists understand subpersonalities or work with them in psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My wife and colleague, Devers Branden, first persuaded me of the importance of subpersonality work to self-esteem and began developing innovative ways of identifying and integrating these parts several years before I became seriously interested in the subject. Our work reflects the observation that unrecognized or disowned and rejected subselves tend to become sources of conflict, unwanted feelings, and inappropriate behavior. Subselves that are recognized, respected, and integrated into the total personality become sources of energy, emotional richness, increased options, and a more fulfilling sense of identity. The subject is a big one and can only be introduced here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To begin with the most obvious example: In addition to the adult-self that we all recognize as “who we are,” there is within our psyche a child-self—the living presence of the child we once were. As a potential of our <a></a>consciousness, a mind-state into which everyone shifts at times, that child’s frame of reference and way of responding is an enduring component of our psyche. But we may have repressed that child long ago, repressed his or her feelings, perceptions, needs, responses, out of the misguided notion that “murder” was necessary to grow into adulthood. This recognition led to the conviction that no one could be completely whole who did not reconnect with and create a conscious and benevolent relationship with the child-self. This task is especially important for the attainment of autonomy. I saw that when the task is neglected, the tendency is to look for healing from the outside, from other people, and this never works: the healing that is needed is not between self and others but between adult-self and child-self. A person walking around with painful and lifelong feelings of rejection is unlikely to be aware that the problem has become internalized and that he or she is engaged in <em class="calibre23">self</em>-rejection, including the rejection of the child-self by the adult-self, which is why no <em class="calibre23">external</em> source of approval ever heals the wound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, what do I mean by a “subself” or a “subpersonality”? (The two terms are used synonymously.)</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A subself or subpersonality</em></strong> is a dynamic component of an individual’s psyche, having a distinctive perspective, value orientation, and “personality” of its own; that may be more or less dominant in the individual’s responses at any particular time; that the individual may be more or less conscious of, more or less accepting and benevolent toward; that may be more or less integrated into the individual’s total psychological system; and that is capable of growth and change over time. (I call a subself “dynamic” because it actively interacts with other components of the psyche and is not merely a passive repository of attitudes.)</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The child-self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche containing the “personality” of the child one once was, with that child’s range of values, emotions, needs, and responses; not a generic child or universal archetype, but a specific, historical child, unique to an individual’s history and development. (This is very different from “the child ego-state” in Transactional Analysis; TA uses a generic model.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nearly two decades ago I gave a self-esteem seminar in which I guided the class through an exercise that involved an imaginary encounter with the child one once was. Afterward, during the break, a woman walked over to me and said, “Do you want to know what I did when I realized that the child sitting under the tree, waiting for me, was my five-year-old self? I created a stream behind the tree, threw the child into it, and drowned her.” This was said with a bitter, brittle smile.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">What the incident dramatizes is not only that we may be unconscious of any particular subself but that awareness may be instantly accompanied by hostility and rejection. Does it need to be argued that we cannot have healthy self-esteem while despising part of who we are? I have never worked with a depressed personality whose child-self did not feel hated (not merely ignored or rejected) by an older part. In <em class="calibre23">How to Raise Your Self-Esteem</em> I offer a number of exercises for identifying and integrating the child-self and the teenage-self (in addition to the work offered in the self-esteem program above).</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The teenage-self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche containing the “personality” of the adolescent one once was, with that teenager’s range of values, emotions, needs, and responses; not a generic teenager or universal archetype, but a specific, historical one, unique to an individual’s history and development.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">I have never worked with a depressed personality whose child-self did not feel hated (not merely ignored or rejected) by an older part</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Often, when working with couples on relationship problems, an exploration of the teenage-self is especially useful. This is the subself that often plays an important role in selecting a partner. And this is the mind-state to which we often revert unconsciously during times of relationship difficulty or crisis, as manifested in such withdrawal behaviors as “<em class="calibre23">I</em> don’t care!” or “No one’s going to get to me!” or “Don’t tell <em class="calibre23">me</em> what to do!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall once treating a couple, both psychotherapists, who came into my office furious at each other. He was forty-one and she was thirty-nine, but they looked like teenagers in their angry defiance of each other. On the way to my office she had said to him that when they arrived he should tell me some particular piece of information; to give her suggestion “authority,” she had evidently dropped into an “older” voice, which he heard as the voice of his mother. “Don’t tell me what to do!” he snapped. As an adolescent she had experienced “constant” reproaches from her parents, and, dropping into an adolescent mind-state in response to his rebuke, she slammed her fist against his shoulder and shouted, “Don’t talk to me that way!” Later, when they were back in their normal adult consciousness, they were mortified at their behavior—“as if we were possessed by demons,” one of them said. This is what it can feel like <a></a>when a subpersonality takes over and we do not understand what is happening. I had helped them pull out of their teenage mind-state by asking them one question: “How old do you feel <em class="calibre23">right now</em> and is that the age you need to be to solve this problem?”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The opposite-gender-self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche containing the feminine subpersonality of the male and the masculine subpersonality of the female; not a generic “feminine” or “masculine” or universal archetype, but individual for each man or woman, reflecting aspects of his or her personal development, learning, acculturation, and overall development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There tends to be a fairly strong correlation between how we relate to the opposite gender in the world and how we relate to the opposite gender within. The man who professes to find women an incomprehensible mystery is almost certainly completely out of touch with the feminine within—just as a woman who professes to find men incomprehensible is out of touch with her masculine side. In therapy I have found that one of the most powerful ways to help men and women become more effective in love relationships is to work with them on their relationship to their opposite-gender-self—making the relationship more conscious, accepting, benevolent, and therefore more integrated into the total personality. Not surprisingly, women are often far more comfortable with the idea that they have an internal masculine side than men are with the idea of an internal feminine side; but neither subself is difficult to demonstrate. (I might mention that none of this has anything to do with homosexuality or bisexuality.)</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The mother-self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche containing an internalization of aspects of the personality, perspective, and values of an individual’s mother (or other older female “mother figures” who had an influence and impact during childhood). Again, we deal with the individual and the historical, not the generic or universal “Mother.” (And again this is very different from TA’s generic “parent ego-state.” Mother and Father are both parents, but they are very different and should not be treated as a psychological unit; they often send very different messages and have very different attitudes and values.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once, stepping into the street with my last client of the day and noticing how chilly it had become, I said to the young man, impulsively and quite untypically, “What! You came out without a sweater?” Before my startled client could reply, I said, “Stop. Don’t answer. I didn’t say that. My mother said that.” We both laughed. For a brief moment, my mother-self had taken over my consciousness.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">In more serious ways, of course, this happens all the time. Long after our mother may have died, we play her messages in our head and often imagine they are our own, failing to realize that the voice is hers, not ours, and that it is her perspective, her values, her orientation that we have internalized and allowed to take up residence in our psyche.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The father-self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche containing an internalization of aspects of the personality, perspective, and values of an individual’s father (or other older male “father figures” who had an influence and impact during childhood).</p>
<p class="calibre2">I once had a client who, when he was kind and compassionate with his girlfriend, later complained of feeling “guilty” about it, which was a puzzling and unusual reaction. What we learned was that the source of his “guilt” was an unrecognized father-self who sneered at him and said, in effect, “Women are to be used, not treated as persons. What kind of man are you?” The client’s struggle became to distinguish his own voice from that of his father-self’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This list of subpersonalities is not meant to be exhaustive but merely to indicate the ones we work with most often in our practice. What each of these subselves needs from us is understanding, acceptance, respect, and benevolence, and in our therapy we have developed techniques to achieve this result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few years ago, Devers identified two other subpersonalities that we find it productive to work with. Technically they are not subpersonalities in quite the same sense as those listed above, but functionally they can be addressed the same way. They are the <em class="calibre23">outer self</em> and the <em class="calibre23">inner self</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The outer self</em></strong> is the component of the psyche that is expressed through the self we present to the world. Very simply, the outer self is the self other people see. It may be a highly congruent and appropriate vehicle for the expression of the inner self in the world, or it may be a highly armored and defended distortion of the inner self.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The inner self</em></strong> is the self only we can see and experience; the private self; the self as subjectively perceived. (A powerful sentence stem: <strong class="calibre6">If my outer self expressed more of my inner self in the world</strong>—.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">A central aspect of our therapy is <em class="calibre23">balancing or integrating subpersonalities</em>. This is a process of working with subselves toward a number of interrelated ends, which include:</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">1</strong>.   Learning to recognize a particular subpersonality, to isolate and identify it within the totality of one’s experience.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">2</strong>.   Understanding the relationship that exists between the adult <a></a>conscious self and this particular subpersonality (for example, conscious, semiconscious, or unconscious, accepting or rejecting, benevolent or hostile).</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">3</strong>.   Identifying the salient traits of the subpersonality, such as chief concerns, dominant emotions, characteristic ways of responding.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">4</strong>.   Identifying unmet needs or wants of the subpersonality relative to the adult conscious self (for example, to be heard, listened to, accepted with respect and compassion).</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">5</strong>.   Identifying destructive behavior on the part of the subpersonality when important needs and wants are ignored or unmet by the conscious adult-self.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">6</strong>.   Developing a relationship between the adult conscious self and the subpersonality of consciousness, acceptance, respect, benevolence, and open communication.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">7</strong>.   Identifying the relationship existing between a particular subpersonality and the various others in the psyche and resolving any conflicts between them (through dialoguing, sentence-completion work, and mirror work).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Devers developed a particularly effective way to allow clients to have dialogues with their subselves. Mirror work with subpersonalities is a form of psychodrama, entailing an altered state of consciousness, in which the client/subject sits facing a mirror, enters the consciousness (ego state) of a particular subpersonality, and in that state speaks to the adult conscious self seen in the mirror, almost always using sentence completions (for example, <strong class="calibre6">As I sit here looking at you—; One of the ways you treat me as Mother did is—; One of the things I want from you and have never gotten is—; If I felt accepted by you—; If I felt you had compassion for my struggles—</strong>).</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We sometimes find that the process of self-acceptance is blocked and we do not know why.</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Whether working with a younger self, an opposite-gender-self, or a parent-self toward the end of integration and a greater overall experience of wholeness, the steps are always the same, in principle, and are indicated above. Through this process we convert disowned subselves from <a></a>sources of turmoil and conflict into positive resources that can energize and enrich us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can we become accomplished at the practice of self-acceptance without learning about subpersonalities? Of course. If we learn to accept and respect our internal signals, to be fully present to our own experience, that is what self-esteem asks of us as far as self-acceptance is concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, we sometimes find that the process of self-acceptance is blocked and we do not know why. Mysterious voices inside our head generate relentless self-criticism. Self-acceptance feels like an ideal we can never fully realize. When this happens, working with subpersonalities can become an avenue to breakthrough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In psychotherapy subpersonality work can be invaluable, since one of the barriers to growing in self-esteem can be parental voices bombarding the individual with critical and even hostile messages. As therapists we need to know how to turn those negative voices off—and turn an adversarial mother- or father-self into a positive resource.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Skills a Self-Esteem-Oriented Therapist Needs</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">There are basic skills that every psychotherapist needs to do his or her work effectively: human relationship skills such as building rapport, creating an atmosphere of safety and acceptance, and conveying a perspective of hope and optimism. Then there are the skills a therapist needs to address specific problems, such as sexual difficulties, obsessive-compulsive disorders, or career problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a therapist sees the building of self-esteem as central to his or her work, there are specific issues that need to be addressed. They can be summarized in the form of questions:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      By what means do I propose to assist my client in living more consciously?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How will I teach self-acceptance?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How will I facilitate a higher level of self-responsibility?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How will I encourage a higher level of self-assertiveness?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How will I contribute to the client operating at a higher level of purposefulness?</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      How will I inspire greater integrity in everyday living?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What can I do to nurture autonomy?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How can I contribute to the client’s enthusiasm for life?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How can I awaken blocked positive potentials?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How can I assist the client to deal with conflicts and challenges in ways that will extend his or her field of comfort, competence, and mastery?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How do I assist the client in freeing him- or herself from irrational fears?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How do I assist the client in freeing him- or herself from the lingering pain of old wounds and traumas, perhaps originating in childhood?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      How can I assist the client to recognize, accept, and integrate denied and disowned aspects of the self?</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">By the same token, a client wishing to assess his or her own therapy could utilize the standards implicit in these questions to examine a therapeutic approach or the personal progress being made with this approach. Thus: Am I learning to live more consciously? Am I learning greater self-acceptance? Does my therapist’s manner of dealing with me contribute to my experience of autonomy and empowerment? And so on.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Fear, Pain, and the Amelioration of Negatives</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Irrational fears almost inevitably have a negative effect on our sense of ourselves. Conversely, the elimination of irrational fears causes self-esteem to rise. This is one of the basic tasks of therapy.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Unhealing pain from the past represents yet another barrier in the quest for stronger self-esteem</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Unhealing pain from the past, because of the sense of debilitation it often provokes and the defenses people typically set against it, represents yet another barrier in the quest for stronger self-esteem. When we are able to reduce or eliminate the pain of psychological wounds, self-esteem tends to rise.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">When we eliminate negatives, we clear the way for the emergence of positives, and when we cultivate positives, negatives often weaken or disappear</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In working with the issues itemized in the above questions, we constantly move back and forth between what I call the “positive” issues (for example, learning to live more consciously) and the “negative” ones (for example, eliminating irrational fears). They are interwoven at every point. It is worth isolating them conceptually for purposes of discussion and analysis, but in reality they do not operate in isolation. When we eliminate negatives, we clear the way for the emergence of positives, and when we cultivate positives, negatives often weaken or disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In recent years significant breakthroughs in psychopharmacology have been achieved, with implications for the amelioration of some “negatives,” particularly among the severely disturbed, the origins of whose problems is surmised to be biochemical imbalances. Many men and women have been enabled to function in the world who could not do so before. But this field is not without controversy. Opponents of the claims made by enthusiasts assert that they are often grossly exaggerated, are not supported by reviews of the research, and that the dangerous side effects of some of these psychopharmacplogical agents are denied or minimized.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_043.html#filepos922217" id="filepos774800"><sup class="calibre39">*</sup></a> I have treated clients before and after their anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive reactions were reduced or eliminated (or masked?) by chemical agents, but what has always struck me is that their fundamental self-esteem problems (and personality structure) remained, quite apart from whether they “felt” better or not. However, one of the therapeutic benefits of their medication, in addition to the alleviation of <a></a>suffering, is that it sometimes made them more capable of participating in psychotherapy. The bad news is that sometimes it facilitated their flights from real problems, the solutions for which demanded more of them than the ingestion of a pill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Methodology evolves and we will continue to discover new ways to achieve our goals in therapy. My primary focus in this chapter is with the question of what our goals need to be. I have wanted to convey basic guiding principles for a self-esteem-based approach.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Therapy of the Future</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As consciousness of the importance of self-esteem spreads through our culture, it is a foregone conclusion that more psychotherapists will be asked by their clients, “How can I grow in self-esteem?” There will be increasing demand for a technology specifically addressed to this issue. But first, there must be an understanding of what, precisely, self-esteem is, <em class="calibre23">and what its healthy emergence depends on</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, there is an approach to self-esteem that thinks primarily in terms of assisting the client to grow in practical efficacy—that is, to acquire new skills. This is an important aspect of self-esteem therapy, to be sure, but it is only an aspect. If the client is living hypocritically and dishonestly, new skills will not fill the void in his or her sense of worth. Or, if the client has internalized the hypercritical voice of Mother or Father (represented by a mother-self or a father-self), a feeling of basic inadequacy or worthlessness can coexist with high achievement. Or, if the client thinks of competence and worth only in terms of specific knowledge and skills, but not the underlying mental processes that make them possible, a deep feeling of inefficacy can coexist with any number of acquired abilities. Regarding this last point: When we say that self-efficacy is trust in one’s competence to cope with the basic challenges of life, we are anchoring this component of self-esteem not in specific knowledge or skills <em class="calibre23">but in one’s ability to think, make decisions, learn, and persevere in the face of difficulties</em>, which are matters of process, not content. An effective self-esteem therapy has to be process focused, but it has to be more than that. It has to be comprehensive enough to address not only issues of competence but also of worth—self-respect: confidence that one deserves love, success, and happiness.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Another tradition has it that self-esteem is the “reflected appraisals” of significant others. Then a therapist might logically tell the client, “You must learn how to make yourself likable to other people.” In reality, however, few therapists would make this statement; nor would they say, “Through therapy you will learn how to manipulate people so expertly that the overwhelming majority will have no choice but to like you—and then you will have self-esteem!” And yet, if one really believes that self-esteem is a gift from others, why wouldn’t one say it? The answer, I suspect, is that no matter how “other directed” one may be theoretically, somewhere there is the implicit knowledge that the approval each of us needs is from within. When we are children, we are dependent on others for the satisfaction of most of our needs. Some children, are more independent than others, but no child can have the level of independence possible to an adult. As we mature, we become “self-supporting” in more areas, including self-esteem. If we develop properly, we transfer the source of approval from the world to ourselves; we shift from the external to the internal. But if one does not understand the nature and roots of adult self-esteem, but thinks in terms of “reflected appraisals,” one is at a severe disadvantage when it comes to putting theory into effective practice.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">If we develop properly, we transfer the source of approval from the world to ourselves; we shift from the external to the internal</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Some psychotherapists identify self-esteem exclusively with self-acceptance and treat it in effect as a birthright, with no further effort required of the individual. This approach conveys a very limited view of what self-esteem is and requires. Important as self-acceptance is, the client will be left to wonder why it does not satisfy the hunger for something more—some height the client may yearn for but have no inkling of how to reach, and no guidance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For these reasons, I recommend that a person seeking professional assistance in raising self-esteem, which is an eminently worthy and admirable undertaking, would do well to interview a prospective therapist and ask these questions:</p>
<a></a><div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      What do you understand “self-esteem” to mean?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What do you think healthy self-esteem depends on?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What will we do together that will have a positive effect on my self-esteem?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      <em class="calibre23">What are your reasons for thinking so?</em></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Any conscientious professional will respect these questions.</p>
