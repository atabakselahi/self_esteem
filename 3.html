<p class="calibre22">What does self-esteem look like?</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are some fairly simple and direct ways in which self-esteem manifests itself in ourselves and others. None of these items taken in isolation is a guarantee, but when all are present together, self-esteem seems certain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-esteem expresses it itself in a face, manner, and way of talking and moving that projects the pleasure one takes in being alive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in an ease in talking of accomplishments or short-comings with directness and honesty, since one is in friendly relationship to facts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in the comfort one experiences in giving and receiving compliments, expressions of affection, appreciation, and the like.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in an openness to criticism and a comfort about acknowledging mistakes, because one’s self-esteem is not tied to an image of “being perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself when one’s words and movements tend to have a quality of ease and spontaneity, reflecting the fact that one is not at war with oneself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in the harmony between what one says and does and how one looks, sounds, and moves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in an attitude of openness to and curiosity about new ideas, new experiences, new possibilities of life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in the fact that feelings of anxiety or insecurity, if they appear, will be less likely to intimidate or overwhelm, since accepting <a></a>them, managing them, and rising above them rarely feel impossibly difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in an ability to enjoy the humorous aspects of life, in oneself and others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in one’s flexibility in responding to situations and challenges, since one trusts one’s mind and does not see life as doom or defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in one’s comfort with assertive (not belligerent) behavior in oneself and others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It expresses itself in an ability to preserve a quality of harmony and dignity under conditions of stress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, on the purely physical level, we can observe characteristics such as these:</p>
<p class="calibre2">We see eyes that are alert, bright, and lively; a face that is relaxed and (barring illness) tends to exhibit natural color and good skin vibrancy; a chin that is held naturally and in alignment with one’s body; and a relaxed jaw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We see shoulders relaxed yet erect; hands that tend to be relaxed and graceful; arms that tend to hang in an easy, natural way; a posture that tends to be unstrained, erect, well-balanced; a walk that tends to be purposeful (without being aggressive and overbearing).</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Relaxation implies that we are not hiding from ourselves and are not at war with who we are</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We hear a voice that tends to be modulated with an intensity appropriate to the situation and with clear pronunciation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Notice that the theme of relaxation occurs again and again. Relaxation implies that we are not hiding from ourselves and are not at war with who we are. Chronic tension conveys a message of some form of internal split, some form of self-avoidance or self-repudiation, some aspect of the self being disowned or held on a very tight leash.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Self-Esteem in Action</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In the beginning of this book I said that healthy self-esteem is significantly correlated with rationality, realism, intuitiveness, creativity, independence, <a></a>flexibility, ability to manage change, willingness to admit (and correct) mistakes, benevolence, and cooperativeness. If we understand what self-esteem actually means, the logic of these correlations becomes fairly obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Rationality</em></strong>. This is the exercise of the integrative function of consciousness—the generation of principles from concrete facts (induction), the application of principles to concrete facts (deduction), and the relating of new knowledge and information to our existing context of knowledge. It is the pursuit of meaning and an understanding of relationships. Its guide is the law of noncontradiction—nothing can be true and not true (A and non-A) at the same time and in the same respect. Its base is respect for facts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rationality should not be confused, as it so often is, with compulsive rule following or unreflective obedience to what the people of a given time or place have proclaimed to be “reasonable.” On the contrary, rationality often must challenge what some group calls “reasonable.” (When a particular notion of the “reasonable” has been overthrown by new evidence, it is that notion <em class="calibre23">and not reason</em> that has been vanquished.) The quest of reason is for the noncontradictory integration of experience—which implies openness and availability to experience. It is the servant neither of tradition nor consensus.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">High self-esteem is intrinsically reality oriented</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">It is very far from that odd notion of rationality that identifies it with the unimaginative, narrowly analytic, accounting mentality, as we find, for instance, in Peters and Waterman’s <em class="calibre23">In Search of Excellence</em>, where “rationality” is characterized in this way and then criticized. Rationality is <em class="calibre23">consciousness operating in its explicitly integrative mode</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus understood, we see that a commitment to rationality and the practice of living consciously entail each other.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Realism</em></strong>. In this context the term simply means a respect for facts, a recognition that what is, is, and what is not, is not. No one can feel competent to cope with the challenges of life who does not treat seriously the distinction between the real and the unreal; obliviousness to that distinction is incapacitating. High self-esteem is intrinsically reality <a></a>oriented. (Good reality orientation, in conjunction with effective self-discipline and self-management, is what psychologists mean by the concept of “ego strength.”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">In tests, low-self-esteem individuals tend to underestimate or overestimate their abilities; high-self-esteem individuals tend to assess their abilities realistically.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Intuitiveness</em></strong>. Very often—especially, for example, in making complex decisions—the number of variables that need to be processed and integrated are far more than the conscious mind can handle. Complex, superrapid integrations can occur beneath conscious awareness and present themselves as “intuitions.” The mind can then scan data for supporting or conflicting evidence. Men and women who have a context of being highly conscious and highly experienced sometimes find themselves relying on these subconscious integrations, since a record of success has taught them that in doing so they succeed more often than they fail. However, when and if that pattern of success shifts and they find themselves making mistakes, they go back to more explicit and conscious forms of rationality. Because the intuitive function often allows them to make unexpected leaps that ordinary thinking may be slower to arrive at, they experience intuition as central to their process; high-level business executives sometimes credit intuition for many of their achievements. A mind that has learned to trust itself is more likely to rely on this process (and manage it effectively with appropriate reality testing) than one that has not. This is equally true in business, athletics, the sciences, the arts—in most complex human activities. <em class="calibre23">Intuition is significant relative to self-esteem only insofar as it expresses high sensitivity to, and appropriate regard for, internal signals</em>. Early in this century Carl Jung stressed the importance of this respect for internal signals to creativity. More recently Carl Rogers linked it to self-acceptance, authenticity, and psychological health.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Creativity</em></strong>. Creative persons listen to and trust their inner signals more than the average. Their minds are less subservient to the belief systems of others, at least in the area of their creativity. They are more self-sufficient. They may learn from others and be inspired by others. But they value their own thoughts and insights more than the average person does.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Studies tell us that creative people are far more likely to record interesting ideas in a notebook; spend time nursing and cultivating them; put <a></a>energy into exploring where they might lead. <em class="calibre23">They value the productions of their mind</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Persons of low self-esteem tend to discount the productions of their mind. It is not that they never get worthwhile ideas. But they do not value them, do not treat them as potentially important, often do not even remember them very long—<em class="calibre23">rarely follow through with them</em>. In effect, their attitude is, “If the idea is mine, how good can it be?”</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Independence</em></strong>. A practice of thinking for oneself is a natural corollary—both a cause and a consequence—of healthy self-esteem. So is the practice of taking full responsibility for one’s own existence—for the attainment of one’s goals and the achievement of one’s happiness.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A mind that trusts itself is light on its feet</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Flexibility</em></strong>. To be flexible is to be able to respond to change without inappropriate attachments binding one to the past. A clinging to the past in the face of new and changing circumstances is itself a product of insecurity, a lack of self-trust. Rigidity is what animals sometimes manifest when they are frightened: they freeze. It is also what companies sometimes manifest when faced with superior competition. They do not ask, “What can we learn from our competitors?” They cling blindly to what they have always done, in defiance of evidence that it is no longer working. (This has been the response of too many business leaders and workers to the challenge of the Japanese since the 1970s.) Rigidity is often the response of a mind that does not trust itself to cope with the new or master the unfamiliar—or that has simply become complacent or even slovenly. Flexibility, in contrast, is the natural consequence of self-esteem. A mind that trusts itself is light on its feet, unemcumbered by irrelevant attachments, able to respond quickly to novelty <em class="calibre23">because it is open to seeing</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Able to manage change</em></strong>. Self-esteem does not find change frightening, for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. Self-esteem flows with reality; self-doubt fights it. Self-esteem speeds up reaction time; self-doubt retards it. (For this reason alone, in a global economy as fast-moving as ours, the business community will need to examine how principles of self-esteem can be incorporated into training programs as <a></a>well as into an organization’s culture. And schools will need these same principles to prepare students for the world they will be entering and in which they will have to earn a living.) The ability to manage change is thus correlated with good reality orientation, mentioned above, and thus with ego strength.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Willingness to admit (and correct) mistakes</em></strong>. A basic characteristic of healthy self-esteem is a strong reality orientation. Facts are a higher priority than beliefs. Truth is a higher value than having been right. Consciousness is perceived as more desirable than self-protective unconsciousness. If self-trust is tied to respect for reality, then correcting an error is esteemed above pretending not to have made one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Healthy self-esteem is not ashamed to say, when the occasion warrants it, “I was wrong.” Denial and defensiveness are characteristics of insecurity, guilt, feelings of inadequacy, and shame. It is low self-esteem that experiences a simple admission of error as humiliation and even self-damnation.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Benevolence and cooperativeness</em></strong>. Students of child development know that a child who is treated with respect tends to internalize that respect and then treat others with respect—in contrast to a child who is abused, internalizes self-contempt, and grows up reacting to others out of fear and rage. If I feel centered within myself, secure with my own boundaries, confident in my right to say yes when I want to say yes and no when I want to say no, benevolence is the natural result. There is no need to fear others, no need to protect myself behind a fortress of hostility. If I am secure in my right to exist, confident that I belong to myself, unthreatened by certainty and self-confidence in others, then cooperation with them to achieve shared goals tends to develop spontaneously. Such a response clearly is to my self-interest, satisfies a variety of needs, and is not obstructed by fear and self-doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Empathy and compassion, no less than benevolence and cooperativeness, are far more likely to be found among persons of high self-esteem than among low; my relationship to others tends to mirror and reflect my relationship to myself. Commenting on the admonition to love thy neighbor as thyself, longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer remarks somewhere that the problem is that this is precisely what people do: Persons who hate themselves hate others. The killers of the world, literally and figuratively, are not known to be in intimate or loving relationship to their inner selves.</p>
