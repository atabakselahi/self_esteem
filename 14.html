<p class="calibre22">To many children, school represents a “second chance”—an opportunity to acquire a better sense of self and a better vision of life than was offered in their home. A teacher who projects confidence in a child’s competence and goodness can be a powerful antidote to a family in which such confidence is lacking and in which perhaps the opposite perspective is conveyed. A teacher who treats boys and girls with respect can provide enlightenment for a child struggling to understand human relationships who comes from a home where such respect is nonexistent. A teacher who refuses to accept a child’s negative self-concept and relentlessly holds to a better view of the child’s potential has the power—sometimes—to save a life. A client once said to me, “It was my fourth-grade teacher who made me aware a different kind of humanity existed than my family—she gave me a vision to inspire me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But for some children, school is a legally enforced incarceration at the hands of teachers who lack either the self-esteem or the training or both to do their jobs properly. These are teachers who do not inspire but humiliate. They do not speak the language of courtesy and respect but of ridicule and sarcasm. With invidious comparisons they flatter one student at the expense of another. With unmanaged impatience they deepen a child’s terror of making mistakes. They have no other notion of discipline than threats of pain. They do not motivate by offering values but by evoking fear. They do not believe in a child’s possibilities; they believe only in limitations. They do not light fires in minds, they extinguish them. <a></a>Who cannot recall encountering at least one such teacher during one’s school years?</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Of any professional group it is teachers who have shown the greatest receptivity to the importance of self-esteem</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Most teachers want to make a positive contribution to the minds entrusted to their care. If they sometimes do harm, it is not by intention. And today most are aware that one of the ways they can contribute is by nurturing the child’s self-esteem. They know that children who believe in themselves, and whose teachers project a positive view of their potential, do better in school than children without these advantages. Indeed, of any professional group it is teachers who have shown the greatest receptivity to the importance of self-esteem. But what nurtures self-esteem in the classroom is not self-evident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have stressed that “feel good” notions are harmful rather than helpful. Yet if one examines the proposals offered to teachers on how to raise students’ self-esteem, many are the kind of trivial nonsense that gives self-esteem a bad name, such as praising and applauding a child for virtually everything he or she does, dismissing the importance of objective accomplishments, handing out gold stars on every possible occasion, and propounding an “entitlement” idea of self-esteem that leaves it divorced from both behavior and character. One of the consequences of this approach is to expose the whole self-esteem movement in the schools to ridicule.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By way of illustration, consider an article appearing in <em class="calibre23">Time</em> (February 5, 1990) that stated:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      A standardized math test was given to 13-year-olds in six countries last year. Koreans did the best, Americans did the worst, coming in behind Spain, Ireland, and Canada. Now the bad news. Besides being shown triangles and equations, the kids were shown the statement “I am good at mathematics.” … Americans were No. 1, with an impressive 68% in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre43">           American students may not know their math, but they have evidently absorbed the lessons of the newly fashionable self-esteem curriculum wherein kids are taught to feel good about themselves.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Some American educators have argued that these figures are misleading because whereas other countries measured the performance of only the top 10 percent of students, the U.S. figures represent a much broader sampling, which brought our average down. They have also argued that in the Korean culture, for instance, it is far less acceptable to say complimentary things about oneself than in the American culture. Just the same, within the limits of his naive and primitive understanding of self-esteem, the criticisms of “self-esteem curricula” the author of this article goes on to make are entirely justified. He is attacking, in effect, the “feel good” approach, and the attack is deserved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, let me stress once again that when I write of self-efficacy or self-respect, I do so in the context of reality, not of feelings generated out of wishes or affirmations or gold stars granted as a reward for showing up. When I talk to teachers, I talk about <em class="calibre23">reality-based</em> self-esteem. Let me say further that one of the characteristics of persons with healthy self-esteem is that they tend to assess their abilities and accomplishments realistically, neither denying nor exaggerating them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Might a student do poorly in school and yet have good self-esteem? Of course. There are any number of reasons why a particular boy or girl might not do well scholastically, from a dyslexic condition to lack of adequate challenge and stimulation. Grades are hardly a reliable indicator of a given individual’s self-efficacy and self-respect. But rationally self-esteeming students do not delude themselves that they are doing well when they are doing poorly.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Self-esteem pertains to that which is open to our volitional choice. It cannot properly be a function of the family we were born into, or our race, or the color of our skin, or the achievements of our ancestors</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We do not serve the healthy development of young people when we convey that self-esteem may be achieved by reciting “I am special” every day, or by stroking one’s own face while saying “I love me,” or by identifying self-worth with membership in a particular group (“ethnic pride”) rather than with personal character. Let us remember that self-esteem pertains to <em class="calibre23">that which is open to our volitional choice</em>. It cannot properly be a function of the family we were born into, or our race, or the color of our skin, or the achievements of our ancestors. These are values <a></a>people sometimes cling to in order to avoid responsibility for achieving authentic self-esteem. They are sources of pseudo self-esteem. Can one ever take legitimate pleasure in any of these values? Of course. Can they ever provide temporary support for fragile, growing egos? Probably. But they are not substitutes for consciousness, responsibility, or integrity. They are not sources of self-efficacy and self-respect. They can, however, become sources of self-delusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, the principle of self-acceptance can have an important application here. Some students who come from different ethnic backgrounds but who are eager to “fit in” may in effect deny and disown their distinctive ethnic context. In such cases it is clearly desirable to help students to appreciate the unique aspects of their race or culture, to “own” their history, as it were, and not treat their heritage as unreal or shameful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What makes the challenge of fostering children’s self-esteem particularly urgent today is that many young people arrive in school in such a condition of emotional distress that concentrating on learning can be extraordinarily difficult. Robert Reasoner, former superintendent of the Moreland School District in California, writes:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Sixty-eight percent of children entering school today in California have both parents in the work force, which means relatively little time spent with either parent. Over 50 percent of students have already seen a family change—a separation, a divorce, or a remarriage; in many districts, by high school 68 percent are not living with their two original parents. Twenty-four percent are born out of wedlock and have never known a father. Twenty-four percent are born bearing the residual effects of their mother’s abuse of drugs. In California, 25 percent will be either sexually or physically abused before they finish high school. Twenty-five percent come from families with alcohol or drug problems. Thirty percent are living in conditions considered substandard. Fifteen percent are recent immigrants adjusting to a new culture and a new language. Whereas in 1890 90 percent of the children had grandparents living in the home, and in 1950 40 percent living in the home, today the figure is down to 7 percent; so there is far less of a support system. As to the emotional life of young people, consider these figures. Thirty to 50 percent will contemplate suicide. Fifteen percent will make a serious attempt to kill themselves. Forty-one percent drink heavily every two-three weeks. Ten percent of girls will become pregnant before they finish high school. Thirty percent of boys and girls will drop out of school by the age of eighteen.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos914965" id="filepos577131"><sup class="calibre39">1</sup></a></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Schools cannot be expected to provide solutions for all the problems in students’ lives. But good schools—which means good teachers—can make an enormous difference. In attempting to raise self-esteem in the classroom, what are the issues? In this chapter I want to address—in broad strokes—the fundamentals that need to be considered.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Goals of Education</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps the place to begin is with how the teacher conceives the goals of education.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is the primary goal to train young people to be “good citizens”? Then a high premium may be placed not on fostering autonomy or encouraging independent thinking but on memorizing a shared body of knowledge and belief, on absorbing “the rules” of the particular society, and often on learning obedience to authority. Earlier in our history, this clearly was the goal of our public educational system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In <em class="calibre23">Breakpoint and Beyond</em>, George Land and Beth Jarman make an interesting observation worth quoting in this context:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      As late as October of 1989, the Association of California School Administrators, operating from a viewpoint of [traditional] thinking, announced, “The purpose of the school system is not to provide students with an education.” Individual education is “a means to the true end of education, which is to create a viable social order.” Here the leaders of one of the largest school systems in the world have declared that students can enter the twenty-first century supported by schools that do not have education as their central purpose!<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915102" id="filepos579266"><sup class="calibre39">2</sup></a></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I vividly recall my own experiences in grade school and high school during the 1930s and 1940s. The two most important values conveyed to me in that world were the ability to remain silent and motionless for long periods of time and the ability to march with my fellow students in a neat row from one classroom to another. School was not a place to learn independent thinking, to have one’s self-assertiveness encouraged, to have one’s autonomy nourished and strengthened. It was a place to learn how to fit into some nameless system created by some nameless others and called “the world” or “society” or “the way life is.” And “the way life is” was not to be questioned. Since I questioned everything and found <a></a>silence and stillness unbearable, I was quickly identified as a troublemaker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many brilliant minds have commented on their dismal experiences in school, their boredom, their lack of appropriate intellectual stimulation and nourishment, their sense that the last thing the educational system was designed for was the cultivation of minds. Schools were interested not in autonomy but in the manufacture of someone’s notion of “good citizens.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In education,” wrote Carl Rogers in <em class="calibre23">On Becoming a Person</em>, “we tend to turn out conformists, stereotypes, individuals whose education is ‘completed,’ rather than freely creative and original thinkers.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Commenting on this disposition of teachers (and parents) to demand obedience and conformity as primary values, to discourage rather than support normal and healthy progress toward autonomy, Jean Piaget wrote in <em class="calibre23">The Moral Judgment of the Child</em>, “If one thinks of the systematic resistance offered by people to the authoritarian method, and the admirable ingenuity employed by children the world over to evade disciplinarian constraint, one cannot help regarding as defective a system which allows so much effort to be wasted instead of using it in cooperation.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">What is needed and demanded today, in the age of the knowledge worker, is not robotic obedience but persons who can think</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">There is reason to hope that this orientation is changing. The assembly line has long since ceased to be the appropriate symbol of the workplace, as we have made the transition from a manufacturing to an information society and mind work has largely replaced muscle work. What is needed and demanded today, in the age of the knowledge worker, is not robotic obedience but persons who can think; who can innovate, originate, and function self-responsibly; who are capable of self-management; who can remain individuals while working effectively as members of teams; who are confident of their powers and their ability to contribute. What the workplace needs today is self-esteem. And what the workplace needs sooner or later of necessity becomes the agenda of the schools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In earlier forms of industrial organization, where a great deal of work <a></a>was repetitive and near mindless, obedience may have been a prized value. It is hardly the first trait a manager looks for today. A superb teacher of teachers and a specialist in educational technology that supports autonomy, Jane Bluestein observes in <em class="calibre23">21st Century Discipline</em>, “There is evidence that children who are too obedient may have difficulty functioning in today’s work world.”<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915288" id="filepos583314"><sup class="calibre39">3</sup></a> Today, a high premium is put on initiative and self-responsibility because that is what a rapidly changing, intensely competitive economy requires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If schools are to be adaptive, the goals of education need to embrace more than merely mastering a particular body of knowledge that students are expected to regurgitate on exams. The aim must be to teach children how to think, how to recognize logical fallacies, how to be creative, <em class="calibre23">and how to learn</em>. This last is emphasized because of the speed with which yesterday’s knowledge becomes inadequate to today’s demands: most work now requires a commitment to lifelong learning. Among other things, young people need to learn how to use computers and libraries to access the ever-expanding new knowledge essential to their progress in the workplace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Schools are criticized at present because it is possible to graduate high school without knowing how to write a coherent paragraph or add up one’s restaurant check. But a mastery of simple English composition or arithmetic, while essential, does not begin to touch what a person must know today at any level above the most menial job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So the fostering of self-esteem must be integrated into school curricula for at least two reasons. One is to support young people in persevering with their studies, staying off drugs, preventing pregnancy, abstaining from vandalism, and gaining the education they need. The other is to help prepare them psychologically for a world in which <em class="calibre23">the mind</em> is everyone’s chief capital asset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I confess to cringing a little when I hear colleagues in the self-esteem/education field announce that teachers must help young people to trust their “intuition”—while not saying a word about teaching them to think, or understand the principles of logic, or have a respect for reason—thus implying that “intuition” is all they need. “Intuition” has a place in the scheme of things, to be sure, but without rationality it is dangerously unreliable. At best, it is not enough, and it is irresponsible to suggest to young people that it is. No one has ever suggested that Charles Manson did not operate “intuitively.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the proper goal of education is to provide students with a foundation in the basics needed to function effectively in the modern world, then <a></a>nothing is more important than building courses on the art of critical thinking into every school curriculum. And if self-esteem means confidence in our ability to cope with the challenges of life, is anything more important than learning how to use one’s mind?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are thinking beings and we are creative beings. Recognition of this fact needs to be at the center of any educational philosophy. When we place the value of these functions at the forefront of our curriculum, we nurture self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Individual teachers and designers of curricula must ask themselves: How does my work contribute to the process of young people becoming thinking, innovative, creative human beings?</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Teacher’s Self-Esteem</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As with parents, it is easier for a teacher to inspire self-esteem in students if the teacher exemplifies and models a healthy, affirmative sense of self. Indeed, some research suggests that this is the primary factor in the teacher’s ability to contribute to a student’s self-esteem.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915474" id="filepos587329"><sup class="calibre39">4</sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Teachers with low self-esteem tend to be more punitive, impatient, and authoritarian. They tend to focus on the child’s weaknesses rather than strengths. They inspire fearfulness and defensiveness. They encourage dependency.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915709" id="filepos587672"><sup class="calibre39">5</sup></a></p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Low-self-esteem teachers are typically unhappy teachers</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Teachers with low self-esteem tend to be overdependent on the approval of others. They tend to feel that others are the source of their “self-esteem.” Therefore, they are hardly in a position to teach that self-esteem must be generated primarily from within. They tend to use their own approval and disapproval to manipulate students into obedience and conformity, since that is the approach that works when others apply it to them. They teach that self-esteem comes from “adult and peer approval.” They convey an external approach to self-esteem rather than an internal one, thereby deepening whatever self-esteem problems students already have.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Further, low-self-esteem teachers are typically unhappy teachers, and <a></a>unhappy teachers often favor demeaning and destructive tactics of classroom control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Children watch teachers in part to learn appropriate adult behavior. If they see ridicule and sarcasm, often they learn to use it themselves. If they hear the language of disrespect, and even cruelty, it tends to show up in their own verbal responses. If, in contrast, they see benevolence and an emphasis on the positive, they may learn to integrate that into their own responses. If they witness fairness, they may absorb the attitude of fairness. If they receive compassion and see it offered to others, they may learn to internalize compassion. If they see self-esteem, they may decide it is a value worth acquiring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, as Robert Reasoner notes:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Teachers with high self-esteem are … more apt to help children develop problem-solving strategies than to give advice or deny the significance of what children perceive to be problems. Such teachers build a sense of trust in students. They base their classroom control on understanding, joint cooperation and involvement, working through problems, caring, and mutual respect. This positive relationship allows children to learn and to grow in their confidence and ability to function independently.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915807" id="filepos590274"><sup class="calibre39">6</sup></a></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">What a great teacher, a great parent, a great psychotherapist, and a great coach have in common is a deep belief in the potential of the person with whom they are concerned—a conviction about what that person is capable of being and doing—plus the ability to transmit the conviction during their interactions. “I always did poorly in math in school,” a client said to me, “and I always knew I could never do well—until I met a teacher who refused to believe me. She <em class="calibre23">knew</em> I could do math, and her certainty had so much power it was irresistible.” The ability to inspire students in this way is not usually found among teachers who have little belief in themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Teachers with good self-esteem are likely to understand that if they wish to nurture the self-esteem of another, they need to relate to that person from their vision of his or her worth and value, providing an experience of acceptance and respect. They know that most of us tend to underestimate our inner resources, and they keep that knowledge central in their awareness. Most of us are capable of more than we believe. When teachers remain clear about this, others can acquire this understanding from them almost by contagion.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes it can be difficult to go on believing in another person when that person seems not to believe in him or herself. Yet one of the greatest gifts a teacher can offer a student is the refusal to accept the student’s poor self-concept at face value, seeing through it to the deeper, stronger self that exists within if only as a potential. (This is accomplished, in part, by making the student aware of choices and options the student had not noted and by breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable units that fall within the student’s present competence and thus give him or her a base on which to build.) A teacher’s own self-esteem can make this task easier.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">One of the greatest gifts a teacher can offer a student is the refusal to accept the student’s poor self-concept at face value</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">For this reason, when I speak at teachers’ conferences, I often spend much of my time talking about what educators can do to raise the level of their own self-esteem rather than about what they can do for the self-esteem of students. Remember the guru with the weakness for sweets.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Expectations</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">To give a child the experience of acceptance does not mean, as we have already noted, to signal “I expect nothing of you.” Teachers who want children to give their best must convey that that is what they expect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Research tells us that a teacher’s expectations tend to turn into self-fulfilling prophecies. If a teacher expects a child to get an A—or a D—either way, expectations tend to become realities. If a teacher knows how to convey “I am absolutely convinced you can master this subject, and I expect you to and will give you all the help you need,” the child feels nurtured, supported, and inspired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A classroom in which what is wanted and expected is that one will give one’s best is a classroom that develops both learning and self-esteem.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Class Environment</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If the primary goal of the educational system is one factor that has consequences for a child’s self-esteem, and if the teacher’s own self-esteem is another, yet a third is the classroom environment. This means the way the child is treated by the teacher and sees other children being treated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">1. <em class="calibre23">A child’s dignity</em></strong>. One of the painful things about being a child is that one tends not to be taken seriously by adults. Whether one is dismissed discourteously or praised for being “cute,” most children are not used to having their dignity as human beings respected. So a teacher who treats all students with courtesy and respect sends a signal to the class: You are now in an environment where different rules apply than those you may be used to. In this world, your dignity and feelings matter. In this simple way a teacher can begin to create an environment that supports self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall an incident many years ago when I was invited to speak at a school for gifted children. During my presentation I invited the students to talk about what it was like to be labeled “a gifted child.” They spoke enthusiastically about the pluses, but they also spoke about minuses. Some talked about the discomfort of being treated as a “family resource.” Some talked about the high expectations of their parents that did not necessarily relate to their own interests and needs. They talked about wanting to be treated “like normal human beings.” And they talked about the ways even loving adults did not necessarily treat them seriously. Present in the room, in addition to the students, were most of the teachers, the assistant principal, and the school psychologist. After the talk, a number of students gathered around to ask me further questions. Then the assistant principal joined in and asked some question of a boy who looked to be about eleven. Halfway through his answer, the school psychologist walked over and started talking to the assistant principal—who turned her back on the boy and left him standing there in midsentence. Astonished, he looked at me and spread his arms, as if to say, “What can you do when you deal with grown-ups? They still don’t get it.” I smiled in understanding and spread my arms, copying his gesture, as if to say, “Yeah, what can you do?” If this assistant principal had been talking to an adult rather than a child and her colleague had interrupted as he did, without a word of apology or explanation, and if she had turned her back on the adult speaking, without even an “Excuse me,” they both would have been perceived as flagrantly rude. Except that, <a></a>since an adult was involved, they almost certainly wouldn’t have done it. Why is discourtesy acceptable if directed against a young person? What message is conveyed? That respect is only appropriate for older people?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">2. <em class="calibre23">Justice in the classroom</em></strong>. Children are extremely sensitive to issues of fairness. If they see the same rules applied consistently to everyone; if, for instance, they see that their teacher has the same attitude and policy whether talking to a boy, a girl, a Caucasian, a black American, a Hispanic, or an Asian—they register the appropriate lesson, they perceive the teacher as having integrity, and their sense of safety and security is enhanced. On the other hand, favoritism (and disfavoritism) poisons a classroom atmosphere. It encourages feelings of isolation and rejection and diminishes children’s sense that this is a world with which they will be able to deal. A teacher cannot help enjoying one student more than another, but professionals know how to manage their feelings. They hold themselves accountable to objective standards of behavior. A child needs the sense that in the classroom, justice will prevail. A teacher who does not understand this can turn an eight-year-old into a cynic who no longer cares to give his or her best.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">3. <em class="calibre23">Self-appreciation</em></strong>. When teachers help a child feel visible by offering appropriate feedback, they encourage self-awareness. When they offer not judgments but descriptions of what they see, they help the child to see him or herself. When they draw attention to a child’s strengths, they encourage self-appreciation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, teachers often tend to concentrate not on strengths but on weaknesses. Johnny is good at English but poor in math, so the whole focus is put on math. Since math does have to be learned, this is understandable, but it is a mistake nonetheless. The mistake is not that the teacher says math needs more attention—it does; the mistake is that the teacher treats this as more important than Johnny’s skill in English. If Johnny is good in English, that is a reason to encourage him to do <em class="calibre23">more</em> writing and reading, not less. Teachers tend to call parents when a child is doing poorly. There is reason to believe that calling them when the child is doing well could be more productive; in the latter case one can still address negatives but not treat them as the most important element in the situation. Help Johnny to be aware of and appreciate his assets. They may indicate where his passion lies and point the way to his future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And even when dealing with weaknesses, a teacher can focus on Johnny’s deficiency in ways that hurt self-esteem: “You’ll never get anywhere in life if you can’t learn such-and-such—what’s the matter with you?” Or the teacher can inspire him to extend his mastery to a new <a></a>field, so that working on math becomes self-esteem building—“You stick with it, even though it’s tough.” The focus should remain on the positive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes a child is not fully aware of his or her assets. It is the teacher’s job to facilitate that awareness. This has nothing to do with phony compliments. Every child does some things right. Every child has some assets. They must be found, identified, and nurtured. A teacher should be a prospector, looking for gold. Try to think back to what it would have been like to be in a class where the teacher felt there was no more urgent task than to discover the good in you—your strengths and virtues—and to help you become more aware of them. Would that have inspired the best in you? Would that be an environment in which you were motivated to grow and learn?</p>

<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">4. <em class="calibre23">Attention</em></strong>. Every child needs attention, and some children need more attention than others. There is one kind of student who is often ignored. This is the student who does his or her work extremely well but who is shy, retiring, and very silent in class. A teacher needs to make an extra effort to bring this child out. This might be accomplished by asking, as often as necessary, “Clara, what’s your opinion?” Or, “What do you think about that, Charley?” Sometimes it is useful to ask such a child to help some other student who is having difficulties with the work, so that the child has an opportunity to “come out” and experience being effective with another person. (The point is not altruism; the point is that the child gets to experience being socially competent. “Peer facilitation,” observes educator Kenneth Miller, “is one of the best things happening in schools today.”<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos915905" id="filepos602622"><sup class="calibre39">7</sup></a> Sometimes it is useful to ask the shy student to stay for a few minutes after class to form more of a personal connection—to send the signal that he or she is noticed and cared about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a signal that every student needs and deserves. Above all, what is needed is the message that what the child thinks and feels <em class="calibre23">matters</em>. The tragedy for many children is when year after year they do not get this message from adults, at some point what they think and feel matters less to themselves. The problem is compounded when children who treat themselves as if they did not matter are praised for their “unselfishness.”</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">5. <em class="calibre23">Discipline</em></strong>. In every classroom there are rules that must be respected if learning is to progress and tasks are to be accomplished. Rules <a></a>can be <em class="calibre23">imposed</em>, by dint of the teacher’s power, or they can be <em class="calibre23">explained</em> in such a way as to engage the mind and understanding of the student. Jane Bluestein writes:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      When we ask our students to do something, we usually have a better reason than <em class="calibre23">because I said so</em>. Telling them the real, logical, and intrinsic reason for a limit or a rule—so the markers do not dry out, so that we do not disturb anyone on our way down the hall, so that no one trips and falls—builds commitment and cooperation even from rebellious students.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos916041" id="filepos604283"><sup class="calibre39">8</sup></a></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher can think about rules in one of two ways. She or he can wonder: How can I <em class="calibre23">make</em> students do what needs to be done? Or: How can I inspire students to <em class="calibre23">want</em> to do what needs to be done? The first orientation is necessarily adversarial and at best achieves obedience while encouraging dependency. The second orientation is benevolent and achieves cooperation, while encouraging self-responsibility. The first approach threatens pain. The second offers values—and power, too. Which approach a teachers feels more comfortable with has a good deal to do with his or her sense of efficacy as a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes a teacher may feel that there is no choice but to motivate by a student’s desire to avoid a negative rather than to gain a positive. Perhaps so. But as an exclusive or dominant policy it is psychologically disempowering. It makes escape from pain more important than experiencing joy—which leads to self-contraction (the contraction of thought and feeling) rather than self-expression and self-development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In <em class="calibre23">Teacher Effectiveness Training</em>, Tom Gordon proposes that students participate in the process of rule setting—that they be invited to think through what an effective classroom requires—and this has the advantage not only of stimulating superior cooperation but also of fostering greater autonomy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The essence of discipline,” writes Haim Ginott in <em class="calibre23">Teacher and Child</em>, “is finding effective alternatives to punishment.” His chapter on discipline in this book is outstanding in the strategies he offers for motivating students in ways that enhance rather than diminish self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Discipline problems often result when children come to school with negative expectations concerning the behavior of adults based on their experiences at home. Without conscious awareness of their motives, they may be disruptive or hostile in class to evoke the kind of punishment they are used to; they may provoke anger because anger is what <a></a>they “know” is in store for them. The challenge to a teacher is not to be “hooked” by this strategy and fulfill the student’s worst expectations. It can be difficult to preserve respect and compassion when dealing with such students, but teachers wise and mature enough to do so can have an extraordinary impact.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Compassion and respect do not imply lack of firmness</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">An examination of the strategies of maintaining classroom discipline is not my purpose here. An excellent treatment of that issue, apart from the Ginott book, may be found in Jane Bluestein’s <em class="calibre23">21st Century Discipline</em>. Bluestein displays great ingenuity in illustrating how teachers can maintain discipline while strengthening the autonomy of the student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She addresses, for instance, the well-known but often ignored principle that misconduct is better corrected by allowing a student to experience its logical consequences than by punishment. When a class was sluggish and uncooperative—repeatedly—about completing a lesson, she announced that class would not be dismissed for lunch until the lesson was completed. By the time the students got to the lunchroom the food was cold and much of it was gone. Next day, every lesson was completed and every desk was neatly cleared two minutes before dismissal time. “I’m still amazed that they all learned to tell time overnight.” She writes:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      In … authority relationships, misconduct is an invitation for the teacher to exercise power and control. Our immediate response, in this type of arrangement, is <em class="calibre23">How can I teach him or her a lesson?</em> In a 21st-century classroom, the lessons to be learned from one’s misconduct come from the consequences of this misconduct, not the power of the teacher…. In the example [of the sluggish class], the students missed lunch because of a poor choice they had made, not as a punishment for misbehaving. As soon as the students got themselves ready on time, there was no reason for the negative consequence (delaying lunch) to continue.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">One last word on this subject. If low self-esteem can impel some teachers to rigid, punitive, even sadistic behavior, it can impel others to the kind of mushy “permissiveness” that signals a complete absence of <a></a>authority—with classroom anarchy as the result. Compassion and respect do not imply lack of firmness. A capitulation to disruptive elements in the class means abdication of the teacher’s responsibilities. Competent teachers understand the need for standards of acceptable behavior. But they also understand that toughness need not and should not entail insults or responses aimed at demeaning anyone’s sense of personal value. One of the characteristics of a superior teacher is mastery of this challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To achieve the results they want, teachers sometimes have to exercise imagination. Problems cannot be reduced to a list of formula strategies that will fit every occasion. One teacher I know solved a classroom problem by gravely asking the biggest, noisiest boy in the class, when they were alone, if he could help her by exercising his natural leadership abilities to persuade some of the others to be more orderly. The boy looked a bit disoriented, evidently not knowing how to answer; but peacefulness quickly prevailed, and the boy responsible felt proud of himself.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Understanding Emotions</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If a proper education has to include an understanding of thinking, it also has to include an understanding of feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, many parents implicitly teach children to repress their feelings and emotions—or those which parents find disturbing. “Stop crying or I’ll really give you something to cry about!” “Don’t you dare get angry!” “Don’t be afraid! Do you want people to think you’re a sissy?” “No decent girl has such feelings!” “Don’t be so excited! <em class="calibre23">What’s the matter with you?</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Emotionally remote and inhibited parents tend to produce emotionally remote and inhibited children. This is accomplished not only through their overt communications but also by their own behavior, which signals to a child what is “proper,” “appropriate,” “socially acceptable.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Further, parents who accept certain teachings of religion are likely to convey the unfortunate notion that there are such things as “evil thoughts” or “evil emotions.” “It’s a sin to feel that!” The child may learn moral terror of his or her inner life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An emotion is both a mental and a physical event. It is an automatic psychological response, involving both mental and physiological features, to our subconscious appraisal of what we perceive as beneficial or <a></a>harmful to ourself.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_043.html#filepos921604" id="filepos612510"><sup class="calibre39">*</sup></a> Emotions reflect the perceiver’s value response to different aspects of reality: “for me or against me,” “good for me or harmful,” “to be pursued or to be avoided,” and so forth. A discussion of the psychology of emotions may be found in <em class="calibre23">The Disowned Self.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">To cease to know what we feel is to cease to experience what things mean to us. This unconsciousnesş is often actively encouraged in children. A child may be led to believe that emotions are potentially dangerous, that sometimes it is necessary to deny them, to make oneself unaware of them. The child can learn to disown certain emotions and cease to experience them consciously. On the psychological level, a child deflects awareness, thereby ceasing to recognize or acknowledge certain feelings. On the physical level, a child inhibits breathing, tenses his or her body, induces muscular tensions, and blocks the free flow of feelings, thereby inducing a partial state of numbness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I do not wish to imply that parents are the only source of childhood repression. They are not. Children can learn on their own to protect their equilibrium by disowning certain of their feelings, as I discuss in <em class="calibre23">Honoring the Self</em>. However, it is undeniable that too many parents encourage the practice of emotional repression by making it a tacit condition of their approval.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the child grows, he or she may slash away more and more feelings, more and more parts of the self, in order to be accepted, loved, and not abandoned. The child may practice self-repudiation as a survival strategy. He or she cannot be expected to understand the unfortunate long-range consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">A teacher is in a position to teach children a rational respect for feelings coupled with an awareness that one can accept a feeling without having to be ruled by it</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can learn to own when we are afraid, and accept it, and (for instance) still go to the dentist when it is necessary to do so. We can learn to admit when we are angry, and talk about it, and not resort to fists. We can learn to recognize when we hurt, and own the feeling, and not put on a phony act of indifference. We can learn to witness our feelings of impatience and excitement, and breathe into them, and yet not go out to play until we have finished our homework. We can learn to recognize our sexual feelings, and accept them, and not be controlled by them in self-destructive ways. We can learn to recognize and accept our emotions <a></a><em class="calibre23">without losing our minds</em>. We can learn to wonder: What might my feelings be trying to tell me? What might I need to consider or think about?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can learn that a pain or fear confronted is far less dangerous than a pain or fear denied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can learn that we are accountable for what we choose to do, but that feelings as such are neither moral nor immoral—they simply <em class="calibre23">are</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, this is the kind of understanding some people gain only in psychotherapy. But in the schools of the future, no one will finish the twelfth grade without having been exposed to these ideas. They will be an integral part of everyone’s education because of their clear importance to the achievement of a decent life.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We can learn to recognize and accept our emotions without losing our minds</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">It need hardly be added that if a teacher is to succeed in teaching self-acceptance, he or she must be comfortable in accepting the feelings of students, must create an environment in which such acceptance is felt by everyone. Children who feel accepted find it easier to accept themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This point was made previously in our discussion of effective parenting and of necessity it is made again here. Indeed, virtually all of the principles identified in the preceding chapter have application in the classroom. For example, handling mistakes with benevolence rather than as if they were shameful; for reasons I trust are clear, how a teacher responds to a student’s mistakes can have an impact on the rest of the student’s life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Few schools today teach the art of thinking and fewer still teach the things I have been saying about emotions. But the schools of the future will have to.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Dealing with Others</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Another subject will have to be added at the grade and high school level: the art of interpersonal competence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If self-esteem is confidence in our ability to cope with the basic <a></a>challenges of life, one of these challenges is to relate effectively with other human beings. This means to relate in such a way that our interactions, more often than not, are experienced as positive and successful both for ourselves and for the other person(s). Consider that today about 95 percent of people who work for a living do so in an organization—they work with other people. If they lack the security and skills to relate competently, they are usually badly limited in what they will be able to accomplish. Any list of the four or five most important attributes for success in an organization mentions the ability to work well in cooperation with associates. True, people who relate poorly to others are sometimes successful, but it is the hard way around and the odds are against it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We know a lot about the skills that make for competence in human interactions, and this knowledge needs to be part of a young person’s education.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We know a lot about the skills that make for competence in human interactions, and this knowledge needs to be part of a young person’s education</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We know, for example, that the best relationships rest on a foundation of respect for self and respect for the other. We know that win-win (mutually beneficial) negotiations, in which both parties gain values, are superior to win-lose negotiations, in which one person’s gain is another’s loss (a theme, incidentally, that is encountered more and more often in business literature). We know that dealing with people fairly and justly provides the security they need to give their best. We know that a spirit of benevolence, compassion, and mutual aid—without self-sacrifice—serves the interests of everyone. We know that people who keep their word and honor their promises and commitments evoke trust and cooperation, and those who don’t, don’t. We know that winners look for solutions and losers look for someone to blame. We know that verbal and written communication skills are of the highest importance, especially in the workplace—and are in fact one of the most significant determinants of career success. We know about active listening and appropriate feedback and the role of empathy—and also about what happens when these elements are missing. We <a></a>know that the individual practice of self-responsibility and the willingness to be accountable can give teams a synergistic power obtainable in no other way. We know that appropriate self-assertiveness can enrich, not subvert, team efforts, and that fear of assertiveness can sabotage them. We know that <em class="calibre23">no</em> human interaction can be optimally successful if one or both parties are afraid of normal self-assertiveness and self-expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this knowledge of less importance to a young person’s education than information about geography?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In providing training in interpersonal effectiveness, we accomplish two goals simultaneously: We nurture self-esteem, and we build competence in that which life asks of us.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Competence and Skills</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We see, then, that what students need from teachers if they are to grow in self-esteem is respect, benevolence, positive motivation, and education in essential knowledge and vital skills.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Necessarily, children arrive in any class with significant differences in ability. Effective teachers know that one can learn only by building on strengths, not by focusing on weaknesses. Consequently, they build competence (and self-esteem) by giving the student tasks geared to his or her present level of ability. The successes that this approach makes possible allow the student to progress to the next step.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher’s job is to make victories possible—and then build on them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the experience of mastering new challenges is essential to the growth of self-esteem, a teacher’s artfulness in knowing how to calibrate this progression is vital.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Grade Curve</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">One of the most unfortunate practices in schools today is marking students on a grade curve. This places every student in an adversarial relationship to every other student. Instead of wishing to be among bright students, one is given reason to wish to be among dull ones—since the competence of others is a threat to one’s grades. Obviously there need to be criteria for measuring progress and for ascertaining level <a></a>of mastery of a subject. I am not criticizing grades as such. But these criteria need to be objective. A standard that has no objective reference to knowledge or mastery and that makes every student the enemy of every other is no friend to self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I cannot write a two-page essay without half a dozen grammatical errors, the fact that everyone else in the class made over a dozen errors does not make me an A student in English Composition. If I am to grow and learn as I need to, I must be held to reasonable standards of competence. To provide those standards is one of the responsibilities of educators. Resorting to the grade curve is a default on this responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Cognitive Individuality</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In the past it was assumed that everyone learned the same way and one teaching method could be right for everyone. Today we know that people learn in different ways, have different “cognitive styles,” and that teaching at its best is adapted to the specific learning needs of individual students.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos916227" id="filepos624504"><sup class="calibre39">9</sup></a> The better schools have begun to integrate this understanding into their teaching methods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To quote Howard Gardner, a pioneering theorist in cognitive science:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Each person has a unique mixture of intelligences, or ways of understanding the world—linguistic, logical, mathematical, spatial, musical, physical (the use of the body to solve problems or make things), understanding of others and understanding of self.</p>
<p class="calibre43">           Also, each person has a different learning style. Some may respond best to visual information, others to language (lectures, reading), others must touch or engage the physical world for things to make sense.</p>
<p class="calibre43">           Once we understand this, it becomes malpractice to treat kids as if their minds were all the same.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos916443" id="filepos625686"><sup class="calibre39">10</sup></a></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Systems have been developed that identify the three or four major learning styles of people, so that course material can be presented in the way most likely to be effective. It is safe to predict that this is going to be enormously important to the self-esteem of young people who in the past would have had to struggle to adopt to a cognitive style less natural to them than their own.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Let us contrast more traditional ways of teaching with the kind of teaching that nurtures self-esteem by way of a set of comparisons. What we are comparing are the characteristics of the obedient student with those of the responsible student—the student who experiences “the locus of control” as external to self versus the student who experiences “the locus of control” as internal. The contrast helps us understand some of the goals of “the new education.” I have adapted this material from Jane Bluestein’s <em class="calibre23">21st Century Discipline</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">To anticipate one of the conclusions toward which I am heading, I want to draw attention to one <em class="calibre23">moral</em> aspect of the shift from the ideal of obedience to the ideal of responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whereas the obedient student will, under different circumstances, sacrifice self or others (this has been the practice of obedient people throughout all of human history), the responsible student, ideally, will be taught to operate outside the sacrifice paradigm. This is implicit in the “win-win” philosophy, although, unfortunately, it has not been identified explicitly. At best, the responsible student may learn a new concept of human relationships <em class="calibre23">that rejects the propriety of practicing human sacrifice</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the one hand, he or she will be far less ready to sacrifice others in pursuit of personal goals. On the other hand, he or she will be far less willing to <em class="calibre23">be sacrificed</em> for the alleged greater good of some alleged higher value—that is, for <em class="calibre23">someone else’s goals</em>. He or she will be far less willing, for instance, to sacrifice a personal life for the good of the company (or the tribe) and will be far less willing to die (or kill) in a war dreamed up by leaders for reasons that offend human intelligence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The obedient student was taught not to challenge authority. The responsible student is prepared to question—and if need be, to challenge—anything. As we will see more clearly in the next chapter, <em class="calibre23">that is what the marketplace now requires</em>. More broadly, it is what civilization requires.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Self-Esteem Curricula</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A number of educators have designed specific programs for the school system aimed at building the self-esteem of students. I will only mention two of which I have personal knowledge and that I admire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have already quoted from one designed by Robert Reasoner: <em class="calibre23">Building Self-Esteem: A Comprehensive Program for Schools</em>. This program has been adopted by a sizable number of California schools, and its success has been impressive—measured in terms of improved grades and attendance, significantly reduced dropouts, teenage pregnancy, and drug addiction, and a massive drop in vandalism. Indeed, most of the schools where the program is used were subsequently ranked by an independent agency to be among the finest in California.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another powerful program is Constance Dembrowsky’s <em class="calibre23">Personal and <a></a>Social Responsibility</em>.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos916654" id="filepos635514"><sup class="calibre39">11</sup></a> The aim of this course is not self-esteem explicitly but the cultivation of self-responsibility and the development of the kind of skills that generate the experience of self-efficacy—which means it <em class="calibre23">is</em> a self-esteem program in everything but name. Designed for teenagers, it can be especially effective with teenagers who are at risk. Ms. Dembrowsky is in the front ranks of those in the self-esteem movement who understand that the roots of healthy self-esteem are internal rather than external. Her focus is on what the young person must learn and do to become empowered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of my hopes for this book is that it will contribute to the creation of new self-esteem programs for the schools designed specifically to develop the practice of the six pillars in young people.</p>
<p class="calibre24">The frustrations, pressures, and challenges teachers face test their self-esteem, energy, and dedication every day. To preserve throughout their careers the vision with which the best of them started—to hold fast to the idea that the business they are in is that of setting minds on fire—is a heroic project.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The work they are doing could not be more important. Yet to do it well, they need to embody (at least to a decent extent) that which they wish to communicate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who does not operate at an appropriate level of consciousness cannot model living consciously for his or her students.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who is not self-accepting will be unable successfully to communicate self-acceptance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who is not self-responsible will have a difficult time persuading others of the value of self-responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who is afraid of self-assertiveness will not inspire its practice in others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who is not purposeful is not a good spokesperson for the practice of living purposefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A teacher who lacks integrity will be severely limited in the ability to inspire it in others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If their goal is to nurture self-esteem in those entrusted to their care, teachers—like parents, like psychotherapists, like all of us—need to begin by working on their own. One arena in which this can be done is the classroom itself. Just as parenting can be a spiritual discipline, a path for personal development, so can teaching. The challenges each present can be turned into vehicles for personal growth.</p>
