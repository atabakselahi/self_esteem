<p class="calibre22">Self-esteem has two interrelated components. One is a sense of basic confidence in the face of life’s challenges: <em class="calibre23">self-efficacy</em>. The other is a sense of being worthy of happiness: <em class="calibre23">self-respect</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I do not mean to imply that a person of high or healthy self-esteem consciously <em class="calibre23">thinks</em> in terms of these components, but rather that if we look closely at the <em class="calibre23">experience</em> of self-esteem, we inescapably find them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Self-efficacy</em> means confidence in the functioning of my mind, in my ability to think, understand, learn, choose, and make decisions; confidence in my ability to understand the facts of reality that fall within the sphere of my interests and needs; self-trust; self-reliance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Self-respect</em> means assurance of my value; an affirmative attitude toward my right to live and to be happy; comfort in appropriately asserting my thoughts, wants, and needs; the feeling that joy and fulfillment are my natural birthright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We will need to consider these two ideas in more detail, but for the moment consider the following: If an individual felt inadequate to face the challenges of life, if an individual lacked fundamental self-trust, confidence in his or her mind, we would recognize a self-esteem deficiency, no matter what other assets he or she possessed. Or, if an individual lacked a basic sense of self-respect, felt unworthy or undeserving of the love or respect of others, unentitled to happiness, fearful of asserting thoughts, wants, or needs—again we would recognize a self-esteem deficiency, no matter what other positive attributes he or she <a></a>exhibited. Self-efficacy and self-respect are the dual pillars of healthy self-esteem; absent either one, self-esteem is impaired. They are the defining characteristics of the term because of their fundamentality. They represent not derivative or secondary meanings of self-esteem but its essence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The experience of self-efficacy generates the sense of control over one’s life that we associate with psychological well-being, the sense of being at the vital center of one’s existence—as contrasted with being a passive spectator and a victim of events.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The experience of self-respect makes possible a benevolent, non-neurotic sense of community with other individuals, the fellowship of independence and mutual regard—as contrasted with either alienated estrangement from the human race, on the one hand, or mindless submergence into the tribe, on the other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within a given person, there will be inevitable fluctuations in self-esteem levels, much as there are fluctuations in all psychological states. We need to think in terms of a person’s <em class="calibre23">average level of self-esteem</em>. While we sometimes speak of self-esteem as a conviction about oneself, it is more accurate to speak of a <em class="calibre23">disposition</em> to experience oneself a particular way. What way?</p>
<p class="calibre2">To sum up in a formal definition: <em class="calibre23">Self-esteem is the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Note that this definition does not specify the childhood environmental influences that support healthy self-esteem (physical safety, nurturing, and so forth); nor the later internal generators (the practice of living consciously, self-acceptingly, self-responsibly, and so on); nor emotional or behavioral consequences (compassion, willingness to be accountable, openness to new experience, and the like). <em class="calibre23">It merely identifies what the self-evaluation concerns and consists of</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In <a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_030.html#filepos476042">Part III</a>, <a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_036.html#filepos781479">Chapter 17</a>, we will examine the idea of self-esteem in the context of culture, but for the moment let me stress one point. The concept of “competence” as used in my definition is metaphysical, not “Western.” That is, it pertains to the very nature of things—to our fundamental relationship to reality. It is not the product of a particular cultural “value bias.” There is no society on earth, no society even conceivable, whose members do not face the challenges of fulfilling their needs—who do not face the challenges of appropriate adaptation to nature and to the world of human beings. The idea of efficacy in this fundamental sense is not, as I have heard suggested, a “Western artifact.” I believe this <a></a>will become still clearer when we explore in depth what self-efficacy and self-respect mean and entail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would be unwise to dismiss definitions as “mere semantics” or a concern with exactitude as pedantry. The value of a precise definition is that it allows us to distinguish a particular aspect of reality from all others so that we can think about it and work with it with clarity and focus. If we wish to know what self-esteem depends on, how to nurture it in our children, support it in schools, encourage it in organizations, strengthen it in psychotherapy, or develop it in ourselves, we need to know what precisely we are aiming at. <em class="calibre23">We are unlikely to hit a target we cannot see</em>. If our idea of self-esteem is vague, the means we adopt will reflect this vagueness. If our enthusiasm for self-esteem is not matched by appropriate intellectual rigor, we run the risk not only of failing to produce worthwhile results but also of discrediting the field.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">To have high self-esteem is to feel confidently appropriate to life</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Am I suggesting that the definition of self-esteem I offer is written in stone and can never be improved on? Not at all. Definitions are contextual; they relate to a given level of knowledge; as knowledge grows, definitions tend to become more precise. I may find a better, clearer, more exact way to capture the essence of the concept during my lifetime. Or someone else may. But within the context of the knowledge we now possess, I can think of no alternative formulation that identifies with more precision the unique aspect of human experience we are exploring in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To have high self-esteem, then, is to feel confidently appropriate to life, that is, competent and worthy in the sense I have indicated. To have low self-esteem is to feel inappropriate to life; wrong, not about this issue or that, but <em class="calibre23">wrong as a person</em>. To have average self-esteem is to fluctuate between feeling appropriate and inappropriate, right and wrong as a person; and to manifest these inconsistencies in behavior, sometimes acting wisely, sometimes acting foolishly—thereby reinforcing the uncertainty about who one is at one’s core.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Root of Our Need for Self-Esteem</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We saw in the previous chapter that self-esteem is a basic need. But why is this so? We cannot fully understand the meaning of self-esteem apart from understanding what about us as a species gives rise to such a need. (I have the impression that this question has been almost entirely neglected.) This discussion, then, is intended to illuminate further what self-esteem ultimately means.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The question of the efficacy of their consciousness or the worthiness of their beings does not exist for lower animals. But human beings wonder: Can I trust my mind? Am I competent to think? Am I adequate? Am I enough? Am I a good person? Do I have integrity, that is, is there congruence between my ideals and my practice? Am I worthy of respect, love, success, happiness?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our need for self-esteem is the result of two basic facts, both intrinsic to our species. The first is that we depend for our survival and our successful mastery of the environment on the appropriate use of our consciousness; our life and well-being depend on our ability to think. The second is that the right use of our consciousness is not automatic, is not “wired in” by nature. In the regulating of its activity, there is a crucial element of choice—therefore, of personal responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like every other species capable of awareness, we depend for our survival and well-being on the guidance of our distinctive form of consciousness, the form uniquely human, our conceptual faculty—the faculty of abstraction, generalization, and integration: our <em class="calibre23">mind</em>.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The right use of our consciousness is not automatic, is not “wired in” by nature</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Our human essence is our ability to reason, which means to grasp relationships. It is on this ability—ultimately—that our life depends. Think of what it took to bring to your table the food you ate today; to produce the clothes you are wearing; to build the home that protects you from the elements; to build the industry in which you earn your living; to give you the experience of a great symphony in your living room; to develop the medicines that restore your health; to create the light by which you may now be reading. All that is the product of mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mind is more than immediate explicit awareness. It is a complex <a></a>architecture of structures and processes. It includes more than the verbal, linear, analytic processes popularly if misleadingly described sometimes as “left-brain” activity. It includes the totality of mental life, including the subconscious, the intuitive, the symbolic, all that which sometimes is associated with the “right brain.” Mind is all that by means of which we reach out to and apprehend the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To learn to grow food, to construct a bridge, to harness electricity, to grasp the healing possibilities of some substance, to allocate resources so as to maximize productivity, to see wealth-producing possibilities where they had not been seen before, to conduct a scientific experiment, to create—all require a process of thought. To respond appropriately to the complaints of a child or a spouse, to recognize that there is a disparity between our behavior and our professed feelings, to discover how to deal with hurt and anger in ways that will heal rather than destroy—all require a process of thought. Even to know when to abandon conscious efforts at problem solving and turn the task over to the subconscious, to know when to allow conscious thinking to stop or when to attend more closely to feelings or intuition (subconscious perceptions or integrations) require a process of thought, a process of rational connection.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We are the one species that can formulate a vision of what values are worth pursuing—and then pursue the opposite</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The problem and the challenge is that, although thinking is a necessity of successful existence, we are not programmed to think automatically. We have a choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are not responsible for controlling the activities of our heart, lungs, liver, or kidneys; they are all part of the body’s self-regulating system (although we are beginning to learn that some measure of control of these activities may be possible). Nor are we obliged to supervise the homeostatic processes by which, for instance, a constant temperature is maintained. Nature has designed the organs and systems of our bodies to function automatically in the service of our life without our volitional intervention. But our minds operate differently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our minds do not pump knowledge as our hearts pump blood, when and as needed. Our minds do not automatically guide us to act on our best, most rational and informed understanding, even when such understanding <a></a>would clearly be beneficial. We do not begin to think “instinctively” merely because nonthinking, in a given situation, would be dangerous to us. Consciousness does not “reflexively” expand in the face of the new and unfamiliar; sometimes we contract it instead. <em class="calibre23">Nature has given us an extraordinary responsibility: the option of turning the searchlight of consciousness brighter or dimmer</em>. This is the option of seeking awareness or not bothering to seek it or actively avoiding it. The option of thinking or not thinking. This is the root of our freedom and our responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are the one species that can formulate a vision of what values are worth pursuing—and then pursue the opposite. We can decide that a given course of action is rational, moral, and wise—and then suspend consciousness and proceed to do something else. We are able to monitor our behavior and ask if it is consistent with our knowledge, convictions, and ideals—and we are also able to evade asking that question. The option of thinking or not thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our <em class="calibre23">free will</em> pertains to the choice we make about the operation of our consciousness in any given situation—to focus it with the aim of expanding awareness or unfocus it with the aim of avoiding awareness. The choices we make concerning the operations of our consciousness have enormous ramifications for our life in general and our self-esteem in particular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Consider the impact on our life and on our sense of self entailed by the following options:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Focusing versus nonfocusing.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Thinking versus nonthinking.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Awareness versus unawareness.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Clarity versus obscurity or vagueness.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Respect for reality versus avoidance of reality.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Respect for facts versus indifference to facts.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Respect for truth versus rejection of truth.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Perseverance in the effort to understand versus abandonment of the effort.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Loyalty in action to our professed convictions versus disloyalty—the issue of integrity.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Honesty with self versus dishonesty.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      Self-confrontation versus self-avoidance.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Receptivity to new knowledge versus closed-mindedness.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Willingness to see and correct errors versus perseverance in error.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Concern with congruence (consistency) versus disregard of contradictions.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Reason versus irrationalism; respect for logic, consistency, coherence, and evidence versus disregard or defiance of these.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Loyalty to the responsibility of consciousness versus betrayal of that responsibility.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If one wishes to understand what self-esteem depends on, this list is a good place to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No one could seriously suggest that our sense of our competence to cope with the challenge of life or our sense of our goodness could remain unaffected over time by the pattern of our choices in regard to the above options.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A disservice is done to people if they are offered “feel good” notions of self-esteem that divorce it from questions of consciousness, responsibility, and moral choice</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The point is not that our self-esteem “should” be affected by the choices we make but rather that by our natures it <em class="calibre23">must</em> be affected. If we develop habit patterns that cripple or incapacitate us for effective functioning and that cause us to distrust ourselves, it would be irrational to suggest that we “should” go on feeling just as efficacious and worthy as we would feel if our choices had been better. This would imply that our actions have or should have nothing to do with how we feel about ourselves. It is one thing to caution against identifying oneself with a particular behavior; it is another to assert that there should be <em class="calibre23">no</em> connection between self-assessment and behavior. A disservice is done to people if they are offered “feel good” notions of self-esteem that divorce it from questions of consciousness, responsibility, and moral choice. There is great joy in self-esteem, and often joy in the process of building or strengthening it, but this should not obscure the fact that more is required <a></a>than blowing oneself a kiss in the mirror (or numerous other strategies that have been proposed, of equal profundity).</p>
<p class="calibre2">The level of our self-esteem is not set once and for all in childhood. It can grow as we mature, or it can deteriorate. There are people whose self-esteem was higher at the age of ten than at the age of sixty, and the reverse is also true. Self-esteem can rise and fall and rise again over the course of a lifetime. Mine certainly has.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can think back over my history and observe changes in the level of my self-esteem that reflect choices I made in the face of particular challenges. I can recall instances when I made choices I am proud of and others I bitterly regret—choices that strengthened my self-esteem and others that lowered it. We all can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With regard to choices that lower self-esteem, I think of times when (never mind the “reasons”) I was unwilling to see what I saw and know what I knew—times when I needed to raise awareness and instead I lowered it; when I needed to examine my feelings and instead I disowned them; when I needed to announce a truth and instead I clung to silence; when I needed to walk away from a relationship that was harming me and instead I struggled to preserve it; when I needed to stand up for my deepest feelings and assert my deepest needs and instead I waited for a miracle to deliver me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Any time we have to act, to face a challenge, to make a moral decision, we affect our feelings about ourselves for good or bad—depending on the nature of our response and the mental processes behind it. And if we avoid action and decisions in spite of their obvious necessity, that, too, affects our sense of self.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our need for self-esteem is the need to know we are functioning as our life and well-being require.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Competence</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I have given the name <em class="calibre23">self-efficacy</em> to that experience of basic power or competence that we associate with healthy self-esteem, and <em class="calibre23">self-respect</em> to the experience of dignity and personal worth. While their meaning is clear in a general way, I want to examine them more closely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, self-efficacy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be efficacious (in the basic, dictionary sense) is to be capable of producing a desired result. Confidence in our basic efficacy is confidence in our ability to learn what we need to learn and do what we need to do in <a></a>order to achieve our goals, <em class="calibre23">insofar as success depends on our own efforts</em>. Rationally we do not judge our competence, in the sense meant here, by factors outside our control. The experience of self-efficacy does not require omniscience or omnipotence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-efficacy is not the conviction that we can never make an error. It is the conviction that we are able to think, to judge, to know—and to correct our errors. It is trust in our mental processes and abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-efficacy is not the certainty that we will be able to master any and every challenge that life presents. It is the conviction that we are capable in principle of learning what we need to learn and that we are committed to doing our rational and conscientious best to master the tasks and challenges entailed by our values.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-efficacy is deeper than confidence in our specific knowledge and skills, based on past successes and accomplishments, although it is clearly nurtured by them. It is confidence in what made it possible for us to acquire knowledge and skills and to achieve successes. It is confidence in our ability to think, in our consciousness and how we choose to use it. Again, <em class="calibre23">trust in our processes</em>—and, as a consequence, <em class="calibre23">a disposition to expect success for our efforts</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be lacking in the experience of self-efficacy, to anticipate defeat rather than victory, is to be interrupted or undermined or paralyzed (to varying degrees) in our efforts to cope with the tasks and challenges life presents to us. “Who am I to think? Who am I to master challenges? Who am I to choose—decide—leave the comfort of the familiar—persevere in the face of obstacles—fight for my values?”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">In a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As far as our upbringing is concerned, one of the roots of self-efficacy is a home environment that is sufficiently sane, rational, and predictable as to allow us to believe understanding is <em class="calibre23">possible</em> and that thinking is not futile. As far as our own actions are concerned, one of its roots is <em class="calibre23">the will to efficacy itself</em>—a refusal to surrender to helplessness, persistence in the quest to understand even in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The distinction between trust in our processes and trust in some particular area of knowledge is of the highest importance in virtually <a></a>every sphere of endeavor. In a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn. To clarify the distinction I am making, let us consider the following example.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us say that a businessman has acquired specific knowledge and a specific set of skills in the field in which he has worked for twenty years. Then he leaves that company and assumes leadership of an entirely different kind of enterprise with different requirements, rules, and problems. If he lacks a healthy sense of self-efficacy, the danger is that he will be overattached to what he already knows and inadequately adaptive to the new context. The consequence is that he will perform poorly and his feelings of inefficacy will be confirmed and reinforced. Alternatively, if he does experience healthy self-efficacy, his security lies less in what he knows than in his confidence in his ability to learn. The consequence is that he is likely to master the new context and perform well, and his feelings of self-efficacy will be confirmed and reinforced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">High-performing salespersons, accountants, engineers, and the like, are often promoted to the position of manager. But the skills needed to be a good manager are different from those needed to be competent in sales, accounting, or engineering. How well the person will do in his or her new job depends in part on the training for the new role provided by the company; but it also will be affected by the level of the individual’s self-efficacy. Low self-efficacy tends to produce discomfort with the new and unfamiliar and overattachment to yesterday’s skills. Higher self-efficacy makes it easier to move up from an earlier level of knowledge and development and to master new knowledge, skills, and challenges. Companies that understand this can build a self-esteem component into their training. They can inspire employees to value the virtues of consciousness, responsibility, curiosity, openness to change, above particular kinds of mastery that may no longer be relevant.</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      A woman who was promoted to manager consulted me because of feelings of panic about her ability to handle the new opportunity. Among the questions I invited her to explore were the following:</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Why were you successful in your previous job?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What specifically did you do in the early months of that job that helped you to develop your skills so effectively?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What attitude of mind did you bring to the new things you had to learn?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      As you progressed in the job, what other things did you do?</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      How did you adapt to changes in job requirements?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What allowed you to be so flexible?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      From what you have learned about yourself and your success in your previous job, what insights do you have that you can use in this new position?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What is it in your inner attitudes and processes that could lead you to just as great a success in the future, even though the actual skills required will be different?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What can you do that will assure your success?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      What is it about you—about the way your mind works—that will allow you to do it?</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Such questions helped her isolate the basic inner sources of her past success as differentiated from particular skills. They focus on process rather than content. <em class="calibre23">They distinguish fundamental efficacy from any of its particular manifestations</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to stress again that no one can expect to be equally competent in all areas—and no one needs to be. Our interests, values, and circumstances determine the areas in which we are likely to concentrate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I say that self-efficacy pertains to confidence in one’s ability to cope with the basic challenges of life, what do I mean by “basic challenges”? For one, being able to support one’s existence, that is, to earn a living; to take independent care of oneself in the world—<em class="calibre23">assuming the opportunity to do so exists</em>. (Wives and homemakers are not exempt. It does not serve a woman’s interest to have developed no skills by which she can support herself and to be frightened of the marketplace.) For another, being able to function effectively in interactions with other human beings—being capable of giving and receiving benevolence, cooperation, trust, friendship, respect, love; being able to be responsibly self-assertive and to accept the self-assertiveness of others. For yet another, resilience in coping with misfortune and adversity—the opposite of passive surrender to pain; the ability to bounce back and regenerate oneself. Simple fundamentals that define our humanity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the examples above I focus on the workplace, but of course efficacy applies also to intimate relationships, as the preceding paragraph makes clear. No experience of efficacy can be complete if it does not include that of feeling competent in our human dealings. If I am unable to create personal and professional relationships that will be experienced as positive <a></a>by both me and the other party (which is what “competence” in the human realm essentially means), then I am lacking at a very basic level; I am without efficacy in a vital sphere. And this reality is reflected in my self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes people who feel fear in the human realm drop to a very low level of consciousness in their relationships and seek the safety and security of competence in the impersonal word of machines, mathematics, or abstract thought. No matter what heights they may attain professionally, their self-esteem remains flawed. We cannot with impunity run from so important an aspect of life.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Worthiness</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Now the second component of self-esteem: self-respect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as self-efficacy entails the expectation of success as natural, so self-respect entails the expectation of friendship, love, and happiness as natural, as a result of who we are and what we do. (We can isolate the two components conceptually, for the sake of analysis, but in the reality of our daily experience they constantly overlap and involve each other.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-respect is the conviction of our own value. It is not the delusion that we are “perfect” or superior to everyone else. It is not comparative or competitive at all. It is the conviction that our life and well-being are worth acting to support, protect, and nurture; that we are good and worthwhile and deserving of the respect of others; and that our happiness and personal fulfillment are important enough to work for.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Self-respect entails the expectation of friendship, love, and happiness as natural, as a result of who we are and what we do</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As far as our upbringing is concerned, one of its roots is the experience of being treated with respect by parents and other family members. As far as our own actions are concerned, one of its roots is satisfaction with our moral choices—<em class="calibre23">which is a particular aspect of satisfaction with our mental processes</em>. (Indeed, a simple and informal self-esteem “test,” though far from infallible, is to inquire of people whether they feel proud of and satisfied with their moral choices. To turn right or left at a street <a></a>corner is not ordinarily a moral choice; to tell the truth or not to tell the truth, to honor one’s promises and commitments or not, is.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not uncommonly we meet a person who is far more sure of his or her competence, at least in some areas, than of the right to be happy. Some aspect of self-respect is missing. Such an individual may achieve a great deal but lack the capacity to enjoy it. The feeling of personal worth that would support and sanction enjoyment is, if not entirely absent, then wounded and impaired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We sometimes encounter this problem among successful businesspersons who are anxious away from their desks. For such persons, vacations are often more a source of stress than of pleasure. They are limited in their ability even to enjoy their families, much as they may feel they love them. They do not feel <em class="calibre23">entitled</em>. They feel they must continually prove and justify their worth through achievement. They are not devoid of self-esteem, but it is tragically flawed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To appreciate why our need for self-respect is so urgent, consider the following: To live successfully, we need to pursue and achieve values. To act appropriately, we need to value the beneficiary of our actions. We need to consider ourselves <em class="calibre23">worthy of the rewards of our actions</em>. Absent this conviction, we will not know how to take care of ourselves, protect our legitimate interests, satisfy our needs, or enjoy our own achievements. (Thus, our experience of self-efficacy also will be impaired.)</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Recently I counseled a brilliant lawyer who was self-effacing almost to the point of self-destruction. She continually allowed others to take credit for her achievements in the law firm where she worked. Her boss took billing credit for hours that were hers. Associates took credit for many of her ideas. She remained cheerful to everyone and insisted she did not mind, while inwardly she was burning with resentment. She wanted to be liked, and she believed that self-abasement was the way to assure it, avoiding thoughts about the cost to her self-respect. Her one act of assertion and rebellion had been to become a lawyer, against the skepticism of her family, who had always minimized her worth. To become highly successful was beyond her view of what was possible or appropriate to her. She had the knowledge and the skill; she did not have the self-esteem. The low level of her self-respect was like a gravitational pull forbidding her to rise. What she learned in therapy was that bringing more consciousness to her choices, taking more responsibility for her self-sabotaging behavior, and acting against that <a></a>gravitational pull—standing up for herself, in spite of fear—was the way to build her self-respect.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Three basic observations: (1) If we respect ourselves, we tend to act in ways that confirm and reinforce this respect, such as requiring others to deal with us appropriately. (2) If we do not respect ourselves, we tend to act in ways that lower our sense of our own value even further, such as accepting or sanctioning inappropriate behavior toward us by others, thereby confirming and reinforcing our negativity. (3) If we wish to raise the level of our self-respect, we need to act in ways that will cause it to rise—and this begins with a commitment to the value of our own person, which is then expressed through congruent behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The need to see ourselves as good is the need to experience self-respect. It emerges very early. As we develop from childhood, we progressively become aware of the power to choose our actions. We become aware of our responsibility for the choices we make. We acquire our sense of being a person. We experience a need to feel that we are right—<em class="calibre23">right as a person</em>—right in our characteristic way of functioning. This is the need to feel that we are <em class="calibre23">good</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We learn the concept from adults, from whom we first hear the words “good,” “bad,” “right,” “wrong,” but the need is inherent in our nature. It is tied to the issue of survival: Am I appropriate to life? To be right as a person is to be fit for success and happiness; to be wrong is to be threatened by pain. When a client in therapy says, “I don’t feel entitled to be happy or successful,” the meaning is, “I don’t feel worthy as a human being.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A concern with right and wrong is not merely the product of social conditioning. A concern with morality or ethics arises naturally in the early stages of our development</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The need for self-respect is basic and inescapable. Inherent in our existence and humanity are such questions as: What kind of being should I seek to become? By what principles should I guide my life? What values are worth pursuing? I say “inherent in our existence” because a concern with right and wrong is not merely the product of social conditioning. A concern with morality or ethics arises naturally in the early stages of our development, much as our other intellectual <a></a>abilities develop, and progresses in step with the normal course of our maturation. When we assess our own activities, inevitably our moral attitudes are part of our implicit context.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible to escape the realm of values and value-judgments because they are demanded by the very nature of life. “Good for me” or “bad for me” ultimately translates to “for my life and well-being” or “against them.” Further, and essential to an understanding of self-esteem, <em class="calibre23">we cannot exempt ourselves from the realm of values and value judgments</em>. We cannot be indifferent to the moral meaning of our actions, although we may try to be or pretend to be. At some level, their value significance irresistibly registers in the psyche, leaving positive feelings about the self in their wake or negative ones. Whether the values by which we explicitly or implicitly judge ourselves are conscious or subconscious, rational or irrational, life serving or life threatening, everyone judges himself or herself by <em class="calibre23">some</em> standard. To the extent that we fail to satisfy that standard, to the extent there is a split between ideals and practice, self-respect suffers. Thus, personal integrity is intimately related to the moral aspect of self-esteem. For the optimal realization of our possibilities, we need to trust ourselves and we need to admire ourselves, <em class="calibre23">and the trust and admiration need to be grounded in reality, not generated out of fantasy and self-delusion</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Pride</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I want to say a few words about pride, as distinguished from self-esteem. Pride is <em class="calibre23">a unique kind of pleasure</em>.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Pride is the emotional reward of achievement. It is not a vice to be overcome but a value to be attained</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If self-esteem pertains to the experience of our fundamental competence and value, <em class="calibre23">pride</em> pertains to the more explicitly conscious pleasure we take in ourselves because of our actions and achievements. Self-esteem contemplates what needs to be done and says “I can.” Pride contemplates what has been accomplished and says “I did.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Authentic pride has nothing in common with bragging, boasting, or <a></a>arrogance. It comes from an opposite root. Not emptiness but satisfaction is its wellspring. It is not out to “prove” but to enjoy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nor is pride the delusion that we are without flaws or shortcomings (as religionists sometimes suggest). We can take pride in what we have done or what we have made of ourselves while acknowledging our errors and imperfections. We can feel pride while owning and accepting what Jungians call our “Shadow.” In short, pride in no way entails obliviousness to reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pride is the emotional reward of achievement. It is not a vice to be overcome but a value to be attained. (In a philosophical or moral context, when pride is considered not as an emotion or experience but as a <em class="calibre23">virtue</em>, an <em class="calibre23">action commitment</em>, I define it differently—as <em class="calibre23">moral ambitiousness</em>, the dedication to achieving one’s highest potential in one’s character and in one’s life. I discuss this idea in <em class="calibre23">The Psychology of Self-Esteem</em>.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does achievement always result in pride? Not necessarily, as the following story illustrates.</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      The head of a medium-sized company consulted me because, he said, although he had made a great success of his business, he was depressed and unhappy and could not understand why. We discovered that what he had always wanted to be was a research scientist but that he had abandoned that desire in deference to his parents, who pushed him toward a career in business. Not only was he unable to feel more than the most superficial kind of pride in his accomplishments but he was wounded in his self-esteem. The reason was not difficult to identify. In the most important issue of his life he had surrendered his mind and values to the wishes of others out of the wish to be “loved” and to “belong.” Clearly a still earlier self-esteem problem motivated such a capitulation. His depression reflected a lifetime of performing brilliantly while ignoring his deepest needs. While he operated within that framework, pride and satisfaction were beyond his reach. Until he was willing to challenge that framework, and to face the fear of doing so, no solution was possible.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">This is an important point to understand, because we sometimes hear people say, “I have accomplished so much. Why don’t I feel more proud of myself?” Although there are several reasons why someone may not enjoy his or her achievements, it can be useful to ask, “Who <em class="calibre23">chose</em> your goals? You, or the voice of some ‘significant other’ inside you?” Neither <a></a>pride nor self-esteem can be supported by the pursuit of secondhand values that do not reflect who we really are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But does anything take more courage—is anything more challenging and sometimes frightening—than to live by our own mind, judgment, and values? Is not self-esteem a summons to the hero within us? These questions will shortly lead us to the six pillars of self-esteem.</p>
