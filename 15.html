<p class="calibre22">Self-esteem, which has always been an urgent personal need, has gained new significance in the last decades of this century. Changed social and economic realities have created new challenges to our trust in ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us remember the primary meaning of self-esteem. It is confidence in the efficacy of our mind, in our ability to think. By extension, it is confidence in our ability to learn, make appropriate choices and decisions, and manage change. The survival value of such confidence is obvious; so is the danger when that trust is missing. Studies of business failure tell us that a common cause is executive fear of making decisions. But it is not just executives who need trust in their judgment; everyone needs it, and never more so than now.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Context</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We live in a period when we are faced with an extraordinary number of choices concerning our values, religious or philosophical orientations, and general life-style. We are very far from being a monolithic culture to which everyone more or less conforms. As I pointed out earlier, the greater the number of choices and decisions we need to make at a conscious level, the more urgent our need for self-esteem. But here I want to focus not on the culture at large but on the world of work—the challenges to economic adaptiveness both for individuals and organizations.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">In clarifying why I assert that the economic need for large numbers of people with decent levels of self-esteem is unprecedented and represents a turning point in our evolution, I must ask the reader to follow me through a number of brief historical excursions. Without this historical understanding, I do not believe one can fully appreciate the moment in history at which we have arrived—nor its significance for self-esteem.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The economic need for large numbers of people with decent levels of self-esteem is unprecedented and represents a turning point in our evolution</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone knows that there have been major developments in the past few decades in the national and global economy. These developments have all contributed to making the need for self-esteem more urgent for all those who participate in the process of production, from the leader of an enterprise to entry-level personnel. They include:</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">1</strong>.   The shift from a manufacturing to an information economy; the diminishing need for manual or blue-collar workers and the rapidly growing need for knowledge workers with advanced verbal, mathematical, and social skills.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">2</strong>.   The continuing and escalating explosion of new knowledge, new technology, and new products and services, which keep raising the requirements of economic adaptiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">3</strong>.   The emergence of a global economy of unprecedented competitiveness, which is yet another challenge to our ingenuity and belief in ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">4</strong>.   The increasing demands on individuals at every level of a business enterprise, not just at the top but throughout the system, for self-management, personal responsibility, self-direction, a high level of consciousness, and a commitment to innovation and contribution as top priorities.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">5</strong>.   The entrepreneurial model and mentality becoming central to our thinking about economic adaptiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">6</strong>.   The emergence of <em class="calibre23">mind</em> as the central and dominant factor in all economic activity.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Let us briefly consider each of these points.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">1. <em class="calibre23">The shift from a manufacturing to an information economy; the diminishing need for manual or blue-collar workers and the rapidly growing need for knowledge workers with advanced verbal, mathematical, and social skills</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">We are manufacturing more goods by far than ever before in our history, but with far fewer people. In earlier decades roughly half the working population was employed in blue-collar jobs; today the figure is less than 18 percent, and estimates are that in not too many years it will be 10 percent. Manufacturing has become much less labor intensive; the cost of labor in the overall process of production has dropped and will drop further. This means, among other things, that the availability of a cheap labor supply has become increasingly irrelevant in terms of competitive advantage. In the United States, the market for unskilled labor has shrunk appallingly—appallingly, that is, for those whose lack of education, training, and basic reading, writing, and arithmetical skills leave them with little to contribute. The demand today is for people with <em class="calibre23">knowledge</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This point is essential to understanding the problem of unemployment among the uneducated and untrained, the so-called underclass of our society. No longer is it enough to have only muscles or to have mastered variations on the kind of physical skills that have been known for hundreds and even thousands of years; not if one wants access to a good job. Today one needs an education. One needs formal training. Or else one needs to be extraordinarily gifted at self-education. And one needs to understand that the process can never stop, because new knowledge begins to make one’s training obsolete almost as soon as one completes it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The situation was very different in the early days of business. Then, the boss knew everything that was necessary to run his business. He might need the assistance of a few other people to carry out the work, but not because they had mastered knowledge of which he was ignorant. As businesses grew and technology advanced, companies began to employ managers and engineers with particular areas of mastery outside the boss’s. But still, knowledge was confined to the very few.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking and decision making were done at the top of the hierarchy and passed down the chain of command. (The army was the only model for a large-scale organization anyone had. Creating the first modern steel mill, Andrew Carnegie sent his second-in-command to study the organization and communication system of the Prussian military and adapted many of its principles to his industry. Previously, the largest ironworks <a></a>had employed six hundred people; Carnegie’s challenge was to integrate and manage the efforts of six thousand.) A few key executives projected the goals and formulated the strategies and tactics the organization was to follow. A few bright engineers made their own contribution. Any knowledge or information about the business or about the wider economic context was the prerogative of this small group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As to the overwhelming majority of employees in an organization, they were told what was expected of them and their sole responsibility was scrupulously to carry out instructions. An ideal employee would be one whose actions matched the consistency and reliability of machines. Frederick Winslow Taylor, pioneer of scientific management, summed up this idea to Harvard students in 1909: A worker’s job “is to find out what boss wants and give it to him exactly as he wants.” It was assumed that the worker could have nothing valuable or creative to contribute to the process of production or marketing. The system at this stage of development did not require for its operation great numbers of persons with firm self-esteem, just as it did not require a highly educated, highly skilled work force.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Today, what we see is no longer “management” and “workers” but an integration of specialists</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Looked at from the perspective of today, it is easy enough to criticize what is now called “classical management.” Understood in its own context, we can appreciate its logic and benefits. A man in 1912 working, say, on an assembly line, might be unable to read or write English—he might be an immigrant from the Old World—but by conscientiously carrying out the task he had been trained to do he could earn a living for himself and his family—a better and more reliable living than had ever been possible before. Frederick Taylor’s great innovation was to analyze production tasks into simple, discrete, easily mastered steps, which no one had thought of doing before, and which allowed people to work “smarter” rather than harder. Raising workers’ productivity, he raised their wages. A blue-collar employee of even modest self-esteem could learn to function effectively in an environment created for him, as it were, by those whose self-confidence and ambition were higher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As technology evolved, the demand for more advanced levels of skill in the operation of equipment increased. But there was no demand for <a></a>higher education or creative thinking or self-management—or autonomy. Such values might make a substantial <em class="calibre23">personal</em> contribution to the average individual’s life, in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction, but <em class="calibre23">not in terms of income</em>. Not in the 1950s or 1960s, at the climax of the industrial phase of our development, when the blue-collar worker was at the pinnacle of success. Then, most college-educated men and women did not earn more than a skilled machinist who was a high school dropout of very limited intellectual development. It is a very different story now, when access to decent jobs requires education and training.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, in a complex business organization that orchestrates the knowledge and skills of financial, marketing, and sales people, engineers, lawyers, systems analysts, mathematicians, chemists, physicists, researchers, computer specialists, designers, health care professionals, experts of every kind—what we see is no longer “management” and “workers” but an integration of <em class="calibre23">specialists</em>. Each of these specialists has knowledge and expertise not possessed by the others in the organization. Each is relied on to think, to create, to be innovative, to contribute. “Workers” become “associates” in an atmosphere that is becoming increasingly collegial rather than hierarchical.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In such a setting, interpersonal competence is a high priority. And low self-esteem tends to stand in the way of such competence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">2. The continuing and escalating explosion of new knowledge, new technology, and new products and services, which keep raising the requirements of economic adaptiveness</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the 1990s, successful business organizations know that to remain competitive in world markets they need a steady stream of innovations in products, services, and internal systems that must be planned for as a normal part of their operations. Conscious individuals know that if they wish to advance in their careers they cannot rest on yesterday’s knowledge and skills. An overattachment to the known and familiar has become costly and dangerous; it threatens both organizations and individuals with obsolescence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Scientific breakthroughs and technological discoveries are pouring from our laboratories and research and development departments at an unprecedented rate. Ninety percent of the scientists who have ever lived are alive now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until very recently, for the hundreds of thousands of years that human beings have existed on this planet, people saw existence as essentially unchanging. They believed that the knowledge possible to humans was already known. As I observed earlier, the idea of human life as a process <a></a>of advancing from knowledge to new knowledge, from discovery to discovery, is only a couple of seconds old, measured in evolutionary time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can be argued that this new development puts the energy of economic necessity behind our continuing evolutionary progress—compelling us to reconceive what human beings are capable of.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">3. <em class="calibre23">The emergence of a global economy of unprecedented competitiveness, which is yet another challenge to our ingenuity and belief in ourselves</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the decades immediately following World War II, the United States was the undisputed industrial leader of the world. We were at the height of our economic power. With the other industrial nations struggling to recover from the wreckage of war, we had no competitors. Our workers were the highest paid. Our standard of living was beyond most of the world’s imagination, if not beyond its envy. Communist and socialist countries were promising someday to surpass us, but that was only a promise for the future, with nothing to support it in the present, although it was a promise that many American intellectuals believed and propagated.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">An overattachment to the known and familiar has become costly and dangerous; it threatens both organizations and individuals with obsolescence</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Business itself—large business—had become heavily bureaucratic, weighted down with many levels of management. It depended more on economies of scale than on innovation to maintain economic supremacy, indulging much undetected financial waste and moving further and further away from the entrepreneurial spirit of an earlier age. (Government policies played a major role in bringing this development about, but that is another story.) Alfred Sloan, famed head of General Motors, once summed up the carmaker’s strategy by saying that “it was not necessary to lead in technical design or run the risk of untried experiments, provided that our cars were at least equal in design to the best of our competitors in a grade.”<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos917072" id="filepos654685"><sup class="calibre39">1</sup></a> One of the last great innovations of the American automobile industry was the automatic transmission—introduced in 1939.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The 1950s and 1960s were the time of the “Organization Man.” Not <a></a>independent thinking, but faithful compliance to the rules, was the road to success. Not to stand out, but to fit in, was the formula for those who wanted to rise. Just enough self-esteem to maintain a decent level of competence within the framework that existed—but not so much self-esteem as to challenge basic company values or policies. What the company promised in exchange was lifetime protection and security. “Be a company man and the company will take care of you” was the promise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-denial for the good of the company was a value that found a ready audience, since, for thousands of years, human beings had been taught that self-denial was the essence of morality: self-denial for the tribe, for God, for king, state, country, society.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos917216" id="filepos655832"><sup class="calibre39">2</sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unions were at the height of their influence and power. Their leaders had little apprehension of the changes that lay ahead. Certainly they did not foresee that by the 1980s, with virtually all their goals achieved, they would be threatened with economic irrelevance, and, like a hemophiliac, would see an increasing percentage of their membership draining away.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Freedom means change; the ability to manage change is at least in part a function of self-esteem</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">“American industry runs on muscle,” a union executive announced. I was sitting beside him on an airplane when he said it. The year was 1962. He began to decry the “disaster” of automation, asserting that thousands of workers would be permanently unemployed because of new machines and that “something ought to be done about it.” I answered that this was a fallacy that had been exploded often; that the introduction of new machines and new technology invariably resulted in <em class="calibre23">increasing</em> the demand for labor as well as raising the general standard of living. I remarked that automation increased the demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor, and that doubtless many workers would have to learn new skills; companies would have to train them. “But,” he asked indignantly, “what about the people who don’t <em class="calibre23">want</em> to learn new skills? Why should they have troubles? Aren’t they entitled to security?” This meant, I pointed out, that the ambition, the farsightedness, the drive to do better and still better, the living energies of creative individuals were to be throttled and suppressed—for the sake of those who had “thought <a></a>enough” and “learned enough” and did not wish to be imposed on further or to think about what their jobs depended on. Is that what he was proposing? His response was silence. I thought: Freedom means change; the ability to manage change is at least in part a function of self-esteem. Sooner or later, all roads lead to self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But change was coming, whether anyone’s self-esteem was ready or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, no one took the Japanese seriously. For a long time Japanese products had been associated with low quality, shoddy imitativeness, and total unreliability. It was inconceivable in the 1950s or 1960s that one day Japan would surpass the United States in automobiles, superconductors, and consumer electronics—or displace the Swiss as the number one producer of watches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When, by 1953, Japan completed its postwar reconstruction, it embarked on an extraordinary pattern of growth that averaged 9.7 percent annually over the next twenty years. Leading this explosion was the triumph of the Japanese automobile. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, Japanese car production increased one hundred times, catching up with the United States in 1979, then rushing on to surpass it. Japan became the leading producer of radios in the 1960s and of television sets in the 1970s. In a total break with the past, Japanese products became associated with high quality and dependability, most notably in high-technology areas such as jets, machine tools, robots, semiconductors, calculators and copiers, computers and telecommunications, advanced energy systems, including nuclear power, and rocketry. Above all, it was a victory of superior management strategy—and the irony was that most of that strategy had been learned from the United States, where it was rarely practiced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the 1980s the United States was facing competition not only from Japan but other Pacific Rim nations as well: South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. That was from the East. From the opposite direction there was a reborn and regenerated Europe—above all, an industrially powerful and fast-growing West Germany.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reaction on the part of American business at first was dismay, disbelief, and denial. Global competitiveness of this intensity was a new and disorienting experience. True enough, there had been competition among the “Big Three” in the U.S. automobile industry, but General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all played by the same rules and shared the same basic assumptions; none challenged the others to rethink their basic premises. The Japanese and the Germans did.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Global competition is a far more powerful stimulant to innovation than domestic competition. Other cultures have other perspectives, other ways of seeing things. Their ideas bring a richer mix to business thinking. But for this reason, a higher level of self-esteem—and competence—is required to play in this arena. At first, American workers and executives refused to acknowledge the Japanese might be pursuing practices worth emulating. The notion of learning from them was perceived as demeaning; instead, their initial response was to dig in their heels and cling more tenaciously to the familiar way of doing things.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos917373" id="filepos661453"><sup class="calibre39">3</sup></a> Sometimes, an additional response was to denounce the Japanese and demand political protection against them. This parallels exactly what one sees in the practice of psychotherapy, when a self-doubting, insecure person blindly persists in counterproductive behavior, clings to the illusory safety of compulsive inflexibility, and blames all misfortune on someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only the shock of devastating competition from Japan and Germany awakened the U.S. automobile industry from its complacent slumber. Whether it awakened in time remains unknown. With no significant innovations of its own for decades, it resisted radial tires, disk brakes, and fuel injection, first put into production cars in Europe. Now it is fighting back, and the quality of American automobiles has greatly improved; but it still lags behind in innovation.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Global competition is a far more powerful stimulant to innovation than domestic competition</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Nor was this American industry unique in its slowness to grasp that the context had changed and that new policies were needed. When the Swiss were shown the first digital watches, their response was: “But this isn’t a watch; a watch has springs and gears.” When they woke up, they had lost their leadership position.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The United States is still—by far—the most powerful industrial nation on earth. With 5 percent of the world’s population, we generate 25 percent of the world’s industrial production. No knowledgeable person ever imagined that we would retain the percentage of world production that we enjoyed in the years following the Second World War, when other economies were in ruins. Nor would it have been considered desirable. We <em class="calibre23">wanted</em> other countries to resurrect themselves and helped to make it happen. Our output of goods and services, overall, is much greater than <a></a>it has ever been; as a percentage of gross national product, it has remained constant for over four decades. In response to changing conditions we have already introduced major changes into our business institutions—from restructuring and “slimming down” (getting rid of superfluous layers of management, for instance) to much greater concentration on quality and customer service, to new systems of organization and management that better support innovation and adaptiveness to a fast-changing environment.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We are now operating in a context of constantly escalating challenge</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">We do face problems of major magnitude: an inadequate rate of economic growth; an educational system that does not meet our needs; a deteriorating infrastructure; a declining standard of living. To what extent these problems will be resolved or get worse in the next decade remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The point now is not that we are in irreversible decline. The point is simply that one of the major changes in the world, with ramifications for business in general and our need of self-esteem in particular, is that we are now operating in a context of <em class="calibre23">constantly escalating challenge</em>. The challenge is to our creativity, flexibility, speed of responsiveness, ability to manage change, ability to think outside the square, ability to get the best out of people. Economically, the challenge is to our innovativeness—and, behind that, to our management ability. Psychologically, the challenge is to our self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">4. <em class="calibre23">The increasing demands on individuals at every level of a business enterprise, not just at the top but throughout the system, for self-management, personal responsibility, self-direction, a high level of consciousness, and a commitment to innovation and contribution as top priorities</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The older bureaucratic command-and-control pyramid, modeled after the military, has progressively given way to flatter structures (fewer levels of management), flexible networks, cross-functional teams, ad hoc combinations of talents coming together for particular projects and then disbanding. The requirements of the flow of knowledge and information are determining organization, rather than preconceived mechanical layers of authority.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">The ranks of middle management have been radically thinned, not merely as a cost-cutting strategy but because computers have taken over the task of relaying information throughout the system, making the role of manager-as-information-relay-station superfluous. Knowledge is more widely disseminated and freely available than ever before, making it much easier for people to operate at higher levels of consciousness in their work and consequently to be more productive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without the old and familiar chains of command, many managers are going through what might be termed a self-esteem crisis: with lines of authority and power no longer clear-cut, they are challenged to find new definitions of their roles. Their need now is to disengage feelings of self-worth from traditional forms of status, or from the performance of particular tasks, and to base it instead on their ability to think, to learn, to master new ways of functioning, to respond appropriately to change. From the boardroom to the factory floor, work is understood more and more clearly as an expression of thought. As equipment and machinery have become more sophisticated, the knowledge and skill required to operate them has risen accordingly. Employees are expected to monitor them, service them, repair them if necessary, anticipate needs, solve problems—in a word, function as self-respecting, self-responsible professionals.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">From the boardroom to the factory floor, work is understood more and more clearly as an expression of thought</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The better organizations understand that the man or woman on the floor is likely to know more about what improvements are possible and necessary—in goods, services, internal systems—than the people above who are more remote from the immediate action. Books on business and management are filled with stories of contributions made by workers to the improvement of processes, services, and products. There are stories of men and women going far beyond their job description in response to unexpected problems they take responsibility for solving. Enterprise and initiative are no longer perceived as the monopoly of a few “special people.” They are perceived as traits appropriate to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not that everyone manifests them. We are still in the early stages of the knowledge revolution. But—increasingly—there is in companies the <a></a>opportunity for people to do so and the hope that they will do so. This in itself is a call to higher self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A modern organization elevates the practice of teamwork to new heights of virtuosity, while simultaneously requiring a core of individualism in each participant—because <em class="calibre23">thinking</em> is an activity of an individual mind, and so is <em class="calibre23">self-trust</em>, and so are <em class="calibre23">tenacity, perseverance</em>, and all the other mind-traits that make achievement possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To quote Charles Garfield in his study of the new policies and philosophy of some of our leading-edge corporations, <em class="calibre23">Second to None:</em></p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      In an area that demands partnership [at every level], a time when our emphasis must shift toward cooperative efforts, the individual paradoxically takes on far greater importance. We can no longer afford to operate companies in which masses of “hired hands” are chronically underutilized while a few “heads” at the top do all thinking…. Competing in an era that demands continuous innovation requires us to harness the brain-power of <em class="calibre23">every</em> individual in the organization.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos917625" id="filepos670489"><sup class="calibre39">4</sup></a></p>

<p class="calibre2">The pressure to remain competitive is forcing a rethinking of every aspect of internal business activity—structures, policies, reward systems, divisions of responsibility, managerial practices (mind work cannot be managed like muscle work), and relationships among all those who participate in achieving productive goals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the lessons business has needed to learn is the importance of entrepreneurship, not just for beginners, but also for well-established industries.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">5. <em class="calibre23">The entrepreneurial model and mentality becoming central to <strong class="calibre6">our thinking about</strong> economic adaptiveness</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">When we think of entrepreneurship, our first association is with independent entrepreneurs who start new businesses or pioneer new industries. And yet entrepreneurship is essential to the continued success of “big business.” This was the lesson of the 1980s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is useful to think back to the early days of American business and to innovators who launched this country on its meteoric growth—as a frame of reference for understanding in what sense “the entrepreneurial mentality” is needed within large business organizations that have existed for years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the advent of capitalism and the emergence of the early American entrepreneurs, a number of shifts in people’s consciousness took place. It is noteworthy that all have a direct bearing on our need for self-esteem.</p>
<a></a><div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      The question, “What has your birth determined you to be?” was replaced by the question, “What have you made of yourself?” In other words, identity was no longer something one inherited but something one created.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      The idea of <em class="calibre23">progress</em> caught people’s imagination. The premise was that intelligence, ingenuity, and enterprise could generate a continuing improvement in the standard of living—that new discoveries, new products, new expressions of human creativity could without limit keep raising the quality of existence. While mind was not yet fully understood to be the supreme capital asset, it had begun to move from background to foreground, sometimes under such names as “competence” or “ability.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Self-reliance and self-responsibility were seen as supremely appropriate in this new order of things, in contrast to the conformity and obedience more valued in earlier, tribal societies. Independence became an economically adaptive virtue.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      New ideas with commercial application were valued. The ability to perceive and actualize new wealth-producing possibilities was valued. The entrepreneurial mentality was rewarded.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Not that these perspectives were understood and embraced equally by everyone. Far from it. Even among some of the best business innovators, traces of the authoritarian mind-set inherited from an earlier age were not fully expunged. Old perspectives and old ways of thinking do not vanish overnight or without resistance. The battle for full acceptance of this new vision is still being fought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The new economic system disrupted the old order of things. It was no respecter of authority. It often disregarded tradition. It did not dread change but greatly accelerated it. Freedom could be intoxicating but it also could be frightening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Entrepreneurship is by its nature antiauthority. It is anti-status quo. It is always moving in the direction of making what exists obsolete. Early in this century the economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote of the work of the entrepreneur as that of “creative destruction.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The essence of entrepreneurial activity is that of endowing resources with new wealth-producing capabilities—of seeing and actualizing productive possibilities that have not been seen and actualized before. This presupposes the ability to think for oneself, to look at the world through one’s own eyes—a lack of excessive regard for the-world-as-perceived-by-others—at least in some respects.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">In the early decades of capitalism, men came out of nowhere, starting with nothing but brains and ambition, created industries, and earned fortunes. Almost all these men started out as workers and almost none graduated high school (few even entered it). They were a challenge and a rebuke to the remnants of feudal aristocracy, to “old money” anchored in social position and disdainful of work, who looked at these new wealth producers with dismay and resentment. The entrepreneur was an impudent upstart, they told one another, whose activities generated social disequilibrium. In fact, he represented a threat not only to their social position but also to their self-esteem. What would become of them in a system geared to merit and achievement, as judged by the market, rather than to inherited status?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If capitalism offered a broader arena for self-esteem to operate in than had ever existed before, it also offered challenges that had no precedent in earlier, tribal societies—challenges to self-reliance, self-assertiveness, self-responsibility, and personal accountability. Capitalism created a market for the independent mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The large organizations that we associate with modern capitalism emerged in the United States only after the Civil War, and in Europe after the Franco-Prussian War—only in roughly the last 130 years. Throughout the nineteenth century, we remained predominantly an agricultural economy: most people earned their living on farms, and land was the chief source of wealth, as it had been for thousands of years. We began as a nation of farmers and small shopkeepers. No one then could have imagined the large industrial concerns and the extraordinary economic development that began to emerge in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, beginning with the railroads, as human energy was unleashed and began to gather momentum.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Capitalism created a market for the independent mind</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The average farmer or shopkeeper was not an innovator. He was typically more self-reliant than his predecessors, to be sure, more independent and more resourceful—evidenced by the facts, among others, that he may have left his homeland in Europe to make a new life in America, and that the looser social structure in the New World, the greater freedom, threw him more on his own and demanded greater self-direction <a></a>and therefore greater self-esteem. But, within the knowledge context of the period, economic adaptiveness demanded of him neither high levels of education nor innovativeness. His mind, learning ability, and decision-making capabilities were not constantly challenged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The individuals who saw themselves thus challenged and were inspired to meet the challenge—the entrepreneurs and inventors—were an almost infinitesimal minority. It is they who were responsible for the transition from an agricultural to a manufacturing society. This led to U.S. leadership in steel, electricity, the telephone and telegraph, farm equipment and agronomy, office equipment, the first household appliances, and, a little later, automobiles and aviation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the height of its success in this century, American business was jolted out of its complacency by foreign competition, and—against the resistance of its own entrenched bureaucracy—forced to think again about the continuing importance of entrepreneurship. Part of the stimulation for this new thinking came from the achievements of smaller organizations, which were pointing the way to the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the last two decades there has been an explosion of entrepreneurship, almost entirely in small- and medium-sized business. By the late 1980s, between 600,000 and 700,000 new enterprises were started every year, as against one sixth or one seventh of these figures during the best years of the 1950s and 1960s. While the Fortune 500 companies have been losing workers steadily since the early 1970s, and many of these companies have been struggling for survival, small- and medium-sized business was able to create roughly eighteen million new jobs; the majority of these jobs were in firms with fewer than twenty employees. Small- and medium-sized business has displayed an innovativeness and flexibility—an ability to respond to market changes and opportunities with lightning speed—too often lacking in larger, more cumbersome organizations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They led the way in showing the path big business must follow if it is to remain competitive. While many companies are still struggling with the problems of balancing traditional, administrative management, on the one hand, and entrepreneurial management on the other—the first is focused on protecting and nurturing that which already exists, the second on making it obsolete—it is increasingly obvious that entrepreneurship cannot be the prerogative of small or new businesses. It is imperative all the way up to organizations the size of General Motors—and right now GM is struggling with just this challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the context of big business, to become entrepreneurial means to <a></a>learn to think like small business at its most imaginative and aggressive: to cultivate lightness, lack of encumbrance, swiftness of response, constant alertness to developments that signal new opportunities. This means, among other things, radically reducing bureaucracy and freeing units to operate entrepreneurially.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to this need, increasing numbers of large organizations have established autonomous or semiautonomous entrepreneurial units internally. Their intention is to free innovators from the obstructions of multitiered, change-resisting, bureaucratic management.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More broadly, they are committed to making innovation a planned for and systematic part of normal operations. They are learning to treat it is a discipline—something that can be learned, organized, and practiced.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_043.html#filepos921819" id="filepos682138"><sup class="calibre39">*</sup></a></p>

<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If low self-esteem correlates with resistance to change and clinging to the known and familiar, then never in the history of the world has low self-esteem been as economically disadvantageous as it is today. If high self-esteem correlates with comfort in managing change and in letting go of yesterday’s attachments, then high self-esteem confers a competitive edge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a principle we can identify here. In the earlier years of American business, when the economy was fairly stable and change relatively slow, the bureaucratic style of organization worked reasonably well. As the economy became less stable and the pace of change quickened, it became less and less adaptive, unable to respond swiftly to new developments. Let us relate this to the need for self-esteem. The more stable the economy and the slower the rate of change, the less urgent the need for large numbers of individuals with healthy self-esteem. <em class="calibre23">The more unstable the economy and the more rapid the rate of change</em>—<em class="calibre23">which is clearly the world of the present and future</em>—<em class="calibre23">the more urgent the need for large numbers of self-esteeming individuals</em>.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">6. <em class="calibre23">The emergence of</em> mind <em class="calibre23">as the central and dominant factor in all economic activity.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The meaning of this statement is implicit in all of the foregoing points, but a few further observations are in order.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an agricultural economy wealth is identified with land. In a manufacturing economy, it is identified with the ability to make things: capital assets and equipment; machines and the various materials used in industrial production. In either of these societies, wealth is understood in terms of matter, not mind; physical assets, not knowledge and information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a manufacturing society, intelligence is the guiding force behind economic progress, to be sure, but when people think of wealth they think of raw materials, such as nickel and copper, and physical property, such as steel mills and textile looms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wealth is created by transforming the materials of nature to serve human purposes—by transforming a seed into a harvest; by transforming a waterfall into a source of electricity; by transforming iron ore, limestone, and coal into steel, and steel into the girders of apartment buildings. If all wealth is the product of mind and labor, of thought directing action, then one way to understand the transition from an agricultural to an industrial society is to say that the balance between mind and physical effort is profoundly altered. Physical labor began to move along a declining arc of importance, <em class="calibre23">while mind began to climb</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an extension of human intelligence, a machine substitutes the power of thought for the power of muscles. While making physical labor less demanding, it makes it more productive. As technological development keeps evolving, the ratio keeps shifting in favor of mind. And as mind becomes more important, self-esteem becomes more important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The climax of this process of development is the emergence of an information economy in which material resources count for less and less and knowledge and new ideas count for almost everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The value of a computer, for instance, lies not in its material constituents but in its design, in the thinking and knowledge it embodies—and in the quantity of human effort it makes unnecessary. Microchips are made out of sand; their value is a function of the intelligence encoded within them. A copper wire can carry forty-eight telephone conversations; a single fiber-optic cable can carry more than eight thousand conversations; yet fiber-optic cables are cheaper, more efficient, and much less energy consuming to produce than copper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each year since 1979 the United States has produced more with less energy than the year before. The worldwide drop in the price of <a></a>raw materials is a consequence of the ascendancy of mind in our economic life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The mind always has been our basic tool of survival. But for most of our history, this fact was not understood. Today it is obvious to (almost) the whole world.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Challenges</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In an economy in which knowledge, information, creativity—and their translation into innovation—are transparently the source of wealth and of competitive advantage, there are distinct challenges both to individuals and to organizations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To individuals, whether as employees or as self-employed professionals, the challenges include:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      To acquire appropriate knowledge and skills, and to commit oneself to a lifetime of continuous learning, which the rapid growth of knowledge makes mandatory.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      To work effectively with other human beings, which includes skill in written and oral communication, the ability to participate in nonadversarial relationships, understanding of how to build consensus through give and take, and willingness to assume leadership and motivate coworkers when necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      To manage and respond appropriately to change.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      To cultivate the ability to think for oneself, without which innovativeness is impossible.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Such challenges entail the need to bring a high level of consciousness to one’s working life, to its demands in terms of knowledge and skills—and also its opportunities, the possibilities for growth and self-development it offers. A commitment to lifelong learning is a natural expression of the practice of living consciously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In dealing with other people, there is the need for that level of self-respect that underlies respect for others; freedom from gratuitous fear, envy, or hostility; expectation of being dealt with fairly and decently; and the conviction that one can have genuine values to contribute. Again we are led to the importance of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an example, consider how poor self-esteem might show up in <a></a>communication. People with troubled self-esteem often belittle their ideas, even while expressing them. They can turn fact into opinion, confusingly, by starting sentences with “I think” or “I feel.” They apologize before presenting a new idea. They make self-deprecating remarks. They laugh to release nervous energy, thus laughing at inappropriate times. They suddenly freeze in confusion and uncertainty because they anticipate disagreement and “rejection.” They make statements that sound like questions by raising the tone of the voice at the end of a sentence. Not all communication problems are the result of inadequate education; sometimes the cause is a self-concept that generates self-sabotage.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A commitment to lifelong learning is a natural expression of the practice of living consciously</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Or consider the issue of benevolence, goodwill, and the ability to interact with others constructively, which relate to a positive sense of self. Men and women of healthy self-esteem do not seek to prove their worth by making others wrong. They do not approach relationships with gratuitous belligerence. It is self-doubt and insecurity that see all encounters—with staff, superiors, subordinates, customers, clients—as overt or covert war.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cooperative endeavors rest on the willingness of participants to be accountable, which is a corollary of the practice of self-responsibility. Such endeavors rest on the willingness of people to keep their promises, honor their commitments, think about the consequences of their actions to others, and manifest reliability and trustworthiness, which are all expressions of the practice of personal integrity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If more is offered to individuals than ever before in our history, in opportunities for fulfillment, achievement, and self-expression, more is asked of them in terms of psychological development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-esteem is far from being the only asset one needs, of course—let there be no mistake about this—but without it the individual is severely impaired and is in effect at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To organizations, the challenges include:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      To respond to the need for a constant stream of innovation by cultivating a discipline of innovation and entrepreneurship into the mission, strategies, policies, practices, and reward system of the organization.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      To go beyond paying lip service to “the importance of the individual” by designing a culture in which initiative, creativity, self-responsibility, and contribution are fostered and rewarded.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      To recognize the relationship between self-esteem and performance and to think through and implement policies that support self-esteem. This demands recognizing and responding to the individual’s need for a sane, intelligible, noncontradictory environment that a mind can make sense of; for learning and growth; for achievement; for being listened to and respected; for being allowed to make (responsible) mistakes.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Since, in the 1990s and beyond, the demand for such mind workers will be greater than the supply, they will be in a position to demand such treatment and to favor the companies that offer it, thus giving these companies an economic advantage. When prospective employees ask themselves, “Is this an organization where I can learn, grow, develop myself, enjoy my work?” they are implicitly asking, whether they identify it or not, “Is this a place that supports my self-esteem—or does violence to it?”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The successful organization of the future will be an organization geared to self-esteem</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that the successful organization of the future will be above all a learning organization. It can equally be said that it will be an organization geared to self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Bringing Out the Best in People</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Leaders do not usually ask themselves, “How can we create a self-esteem-supporting culture in our organization?” But the best (the most conscious) of them do ask, “What can we do to stimulate innovation and creativity? How can we make this the kind of place that will attract the best people? And what can we do to earn their continuing loyalty?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">These questions are all different, and yet the answers to them are largely the same or at least significantly overlap. It would be impossible to have an organization that nurtured innovation and creativity and yet <a></a>did not nurture self-esteem in some important ways. It would be impossible to have an organization that nurtured self-esteem, rationally understood, and yet did not stimulate innovation, creativity, excitement, and loyalty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An example: Some businesses are experimenting with tying pay raises to the acquisition of new knowledge and skills; employees are paid to learn, paid to master new areas of expertise. The assumption is that the more knowledgeable and skilled they are, the greater the contribution to the company they will be able to make. But will not a growth in competence very likely lead to an increase in the experience of self-efficacy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the point of view of the individual, it is obvious that work can be a vehicle for raising self-esteem. The six pillars all have clear application here. When we bring a high level of consciousness, responsibility, and so on to our tasks, self-esteem is strengthened—just as, when we avoid them, self-esteem is weakened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I am invited by companies to teach how self-esteem principles and technology can be utilized to stimulate higher performance, I often work with the sentence-completion technique, asking participants in the program to write six to ten endings every day, over a period of some weeks, for sentence stems such as the following:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my work today—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more self-acceptance to my daily activities—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I operate 5 percent more self-responsibly today—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I operate 5 percent more self-assertively today—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I operate 5 percent more purposefully today—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity to my work today—</strong></p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Stems such as these and dozens of others like them invariably stimulate a direct experience of what the practice of the six pillars means, not only for self-esteem, but also for productivity and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this section I want to focus on self-esteem from the perspective of the organization—the kind of policies and practices that either undermine or support the self-efficacy and self-respect of people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An organization whose people operate at a high level of consciousness, self-acceptance (and acceptance of others), self-responsibility, self-assertiveness (and respect for the assertiveness of others), purposefulness, and personal integrity would be an organization of extraordinarily empowered human beings. These traits are supported in an organization to the extent that the following conditions are met:</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">1</strong>.   People feel safe: secure that they will not be ridiculed, demeaned, humiliated, or punished for openness and honesty or for admitting “I made a mistake” or for saying “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.”</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">2</strong>.   People feel accepted: treated with courtesy, listened to, invited to express thoughts and feelings, dealt with as individuals whose dignity is important.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">3</strong>.   People feel challenged: given assignments that excite, inspire, and test and stretch their abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">4</strong>.   People feel recognized: acknowledged for individual talents and achievements and rewarded monetarily and nonmonetarily for extraordinary contributions.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">5</strong>.   People receive constructive feedback: they hear how to improve performance in nondemeaning ways that stress positives rather than negatives and that build on their strengths.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">6</strong>.   People see that innovation is expected of them: their opinions are solicited, their brainstorming is invited, and they see that the development of new and usable ideas is desired of them and welcomed.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">7</strong>.   People are given easy access to information: not only are they given the information (and resources) they need to do their job properly, they are given information about the wider context in which they work—the goals and progress of the company—so that they can understand how their activities relate to the organization’s overall mission.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">8</strong>.   People are given authority appropriate to what they are accountable for: they are encouraged to take initiative, make decisions, exercise judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">9</strong>.   People are given clear-cut and noncontradictory rules and guidelines: they are provided with a structure their intelligence can grasp and count on and they know what is expected of them.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">10</strong>.   People are encouraged to solve as many of their own problems as possible: they are expected to resolve issues close to the action rather than pass responsibility for solutions to higher-ups, and they are empowered to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">11</strong>.   People see that their rewards for successes are far greater than any penalties for failures: in too many companies, where the penalties for mistakes are much greater than the rewards for success, people are afraid to take risks or express themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">12</strong>.   People are encouraged and rewarded for learning: they are encouraged to participate in internal and external courses and programs that will expand their knowledge and skills.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">13</strong>.   People experience congruence between an organization’s mission statement and professed philosophy, on the one hand, and the behavior of leaders and managers, on the other: they see integrity exemplified and they feel motivated to match what they see.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">14</strong>.   People experience being treated fairly and justly: they feel the workplace is a rational universe they can trust.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">15</strong>.   People are able to believe in and take pride in the value of what they produce: they perceive the result of their efforts as genuinely useful, they perceive their work as worth doing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the extent that these conditions are operative in an organization, it will be a place in which high-self-esteem people will want to work. It will also be one in which people of more modest self-esteem will find their self-esteem raised.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">What Managers Can Do</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When I sat with a group of managers once, outlining the above set of conditions, one of them remarked, “You talk about self-esteem, but what you have described are conditions that stimulate active and creative employee participation—that stimulate innovation.” Precisely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For executives who want to build a high-self-esteem organization I would structure a different but inevitably overlapping list of proposals:</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">1</strong>.   Work on your own self-esteem: commit yourself to raising the level of consciousness, responsibility, and integrity you bring to your work and your dealings with people—staff, subordinates, associates, higher-ups, customers, and suppliers.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">2</strong>.   When you talk with your people, be present to the experience: make eye contact, listen actively, offer appropriate feedback, give the speaker the experience of being heard.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">3</strong>.   Be empathic: let the speaker know that you understand his or her feelings as well as statements, which is a way of giving the speaker an experience of visibility.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">4</strong>.   Regardless of who you are speaking to, maintain a tone of respect: do not permit yourself a condescending, superior, sarcastic, or blaming tone.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">5</strong>.   Keep encounters regarding work task-centered, not ego-centered: <a></a>never permit a dispute to deteriorate into a conflict of personalities; the focus needs to be <em class="calibre23">on reality</em>—“What is the situation?” “What does the work require?” “What needs to be done?”</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">6</strong>.   Give your people opportunities to practice self-responsibility: give them space to take the initiative, volunteer ideas, attempt new tasks, expand their range.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">7</strong>.   Speak to your people’s understanding: give the reasons for rules and guidelines (when they are not self-evident), explain why you cannot accommodate certain requests; don’t merely hand down orders from on high.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">8</strong>.   If you make a mistake in your dealings with someone, are unfair or short-tempered, admit it and apologize: do not imagine (like some autocratic parents) that it would demean your dignity or position to admit taking an action you regret.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">9</strong>.   Invite your people to give you feedback on the kind of boss you are: I agree with someone who once said that “you are the kind of manager your people say you are,” so check it out and let your people see that you are open to learning and self-correction, and set an example of nondefensiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">10</strong>.   Let your people see that it’s safe to make a mistake or say “I don’t know, but I will find out”: to evoke fear of error or ignorance is to invite deception, inhibition, and an end to creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">11</strong>.   Let your people see that it’s safe to disagree with you: convey respect for differences of opinion and do not punish dissent.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">12</strong>.   Describe undesirable behavior without blaming: let someone know if his or her behavior is unacceptable, point out its consequences, communicate what kind of behavior you want instead, and omit character assassination.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">13</strong>.   Let your people see that you talk honestly about your feelings: if you are hurt or angry or offended, say so with honesty and dignity (and give everyone a lesson in the strength of self-acceptance).</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">14</strong>.   If someone does superior work or makes an excellent decision, invite him or her to explore how and why it happened: do not limit yourself simply to praise; by asking appropriate questions, help raise the person’s consciousness about what made the achievement possible and thereby increase the likelihood that others like it will occur in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">15</strong>.   If someone does unacceptable work or makes a bad decision, practice the same principle as above: do not limit yourself to corrective feedback; invite an exploration of what made the error <a></a>possible, thus raising the level of consciousness and minimizing the likelihood of a repetition.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">16</strong>.   Give clear and unequivocal performance standards: let people understand your nonnegotiable expectations regarding the quality of work.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">17</strong>.   Praise in public and correct in private: acknowledge achievements in the hearing of as many people as possible while letting a person absorb corrections in the safety of privacy.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">18</strong>.   Let your praise be realistic: like parents who make compliments meaningless by praising extravagantly for trivia, you can make your positive acknowledgments devoid of force if they are overblown and not calibrated to the reality of what has been accomplished.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">19</strong>.   When the behavior of someone creates a problem, ask him or her to propose a solution: whenever possible, avoid handing down solutions but give the problem to the responsible party, thereby encouraging self-responsibility, self-assertiveness, and intensified awareness.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">20</strong>.   Convey in every way possible that you are not interested in blaming, you are interested in solutions, and exemplify this policy personally: when we look for solutions, we grow in self-esteem; when we blame (or alibi), we weaken self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">21</strong>.   Give your people the resources, information, and authority to do what you have asked them to do: remember that there can be no responsibility without power, and nothing so undermines morale as assigning the first without giving the second.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">22</strong>.   Remember that a great manager or leader is not one who comes up with brilliant solutions but who sees to it that his people come up with brilliant solutions: a manager, at his or her best, is a coach, not a problem solver for admiring children.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">23</strong>.   Take personal responsibility for creating a culture of self-esteem: no matter what “self-esteem training” they might be given, subordinates are unlikely to sustain the kind of behavior I am recommending if they do not see it exemplified by the higher-ups.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">24</strong>.   Work at changing aspects of the organization’s culture that undermine self-esteem: traditional procedures, originating in an older model of management, may stifle not only self-esteem but also any creativity or innovation (such as requiring that all significant decisions be passed up a chain of command, thus leaving those close to the action disempowered and paralyzed).</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">25</strong>.   Avoid overdirecting, overobserving, and overreporting: excessive “managing” (“micromanaging”) is the enemy of autonomy and creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">26</strong>.   Plan and budget appropriately for innovation: do not ask for people’s innovative best and then announce there is no money (or other resources), because the danger is that creative enthusiasm will dry up and be replaced by demoralization.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">27</strong>.   Find out what the central interests of your people are and, whenever possible, match tasks and objectives with individual dispositions: give people an opportunity to do what they enjoy most and do best; build on people’s strengths.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">28</strong>.   Ask your people what they would need in order to feel more in control of their work and, if possible, give it to them: if you want to promote autonomy, excitement, and a strong commitment to goals, empower, empower, empower.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">29</strong>.   Reward such natural expressions of self-esteem as self-assertiveness, (intelligent) risk taking, flexible behavior patterns, and a strong action orientation: too many companies pay lip service to such values while rewarding those who conform, don’t ask difficult questions, don’t challenge the status quo, and remain essentially passive while performing the motions of their job description.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">30</strong>.   Give assignments that stimulate personal and professional growth: without an experience of growth, self-esteem—and enthusiasm for the job—tends to be undermined.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">31</strong>.   Stretch your people: assign tasks and projects slightly beyond their known capabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">32</strong>.   Educate your people to see problems as challenges and opportunities; this is one perspective clearly shared by high achievers and by people of high self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">33</strong>.   Support the talented non-team player: in spite of everything we can say about the necessity for effective teamwork, there needs to be a place for the brilliant hermit who is moving to different music, and even team players benefit from seeing this respect for individuality.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">34</strong>.   Teach that errors and mistakes are opportunities for learning: “What can you learn from what happened?” is a question that promotes self-esteem; it also promotes not repeating mistakes; and sometimes it points the way to a future solution.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">35</strong>.   Challenge the seniority tradition and promote from any level on <a></a>the basis of merit: recognition of ability is one of the great inspirers of self-respect.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">36</strong>.   Reward generously for outstanding contributions, such as new products, inventions, services, and money-saving projects: profit-sharing programs, deferred compensation plans, cash or stock bonuses, and royalties can all be used to reinforce the signal that your organization wants innovation and respects intelligent self-assertion and self-expression.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">37</strong>.   Write letters of commendation and appreciation to high achievers and ask the CEO to do likewise: when people see that their company values their <em class="calibre23">mind</em>, they are motivated to keep pushing at the limits of what they feel capable of achieving.</p>
<p class="calibre35">   <strong class="calibre6">38</strong>.   Set a standard of personal integrity: keep your promises, honor your commitments, deal with everyone fairly (not just insiders, but suppliers and customers as well), and acknowledge and support this behavior in others; give your people the pride of working for a <em class="calibre23">moral</em> company.</p>
<p class="calibre36">I doubt that there is one principle listed above that thoughtful executives are not aware of—in the abstract. The challenge is to practice them consistently and weave them into the fabric of daily procedures.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Leader’s Role</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Everything I have said above clearly applies to leaders—the CEO or company president—as much as to managers. But I want to say a few additional words about the leader.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The primary function of a leader in a business enterprise is (1) to develop and persuasively convey a vision of what the organization is to accomplish, and (2) to inspire and empower all those who work for the organization to make an optimal contribution to the fulfillment of that vision and to experience that, in doing so, they are acting in alignment with their self-interest. The leader must be an inspirer and a persuader.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The higher the self-esteem of the leader, the more likely it is that he or she can perform that function successfully. A mind that distrusts itself cannot inspire the best in the minds of others. Neither can leaders inspire the best in others if their primary need, arising from their insecurities, is to prove themselves right and others wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a fallacy to say that a great leader should be egoless. A leader needs <a></a>an ego sufficiently healthy that it does not experience itself as on the line in every encounter—so that the leader is free to be task and results oriented, not self-aggrandizement or self-protection oriented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If degrees of self-esteem are thought of on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 representing optimal self-esteem and 1 almost the lowest imaginable, then is a leader who is a 5 more likely to hire a 7 or a 3? Very likely he or she will feel more comfortable with the 3, since people often feel intimated by others more confident than themselves. Multiply this example hundreds or thousands of times and project the consequences for a business.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Warren Bennis, our preeminent scholar of leadership, tells us that the basic passion in the best leaders he has studied is for self-expression.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos917802" id="filepos720268"><sup class="calibre39">5</sup></a> Their work is clearly a vehicle for self-actualization. Their desire is to bring “who they are” into the world, into reality, which I speak of as the practice of self-assertiveness.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">It is a fallacy to say that a great leader should be egoless</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Leaders often do not fully recognize the extent to which “who they are” affects virtually every aspect of their organization. They do not appreciate the extent to which they are role models. Their smallest bits of behavior are noted and absorbed by those around them, not necessarily consciously, and reflected via those they influence throughout the entire organization. If a leader has unimpeachable integrity, a standard is set that others feel drawn to follow. If a leader treats people with respect—associates, subordinates, customers, suppliers, shareholders—that tends to translate into company culture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For these reasons, a person who wants to work on his or her “leadership ability” should work on self-esteem. Continual dedication to the six pillars and their daily practice is the very best training for leadership—as it is for life.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Power to Do Good</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Can the right organizational environment transform a person of low self-esteem into one of high self-esteem? Not very likely—although I can think of instances where a good manager or supervisor drew out of a <a></a>person what no one had ever drawn out before and at least laid a foundation for improved self-respect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clearly there are troubled individuals who need a more focused kind of professional help—I am speaking of psychotherapy, which we will discuss in the following chapter—and it is not the function of a business organization to be a psychological clinic.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The policies that support self-esteem are also the policies that make money.</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">But for the person of average self-esteem, an organization dedicated to the value and importance of the individual has an immense potential for doing good at the most intimate and personal level, even though that is not, of course, its purpose for being. And in doing so, it contributes to its own life and vitality in ways that are not remote and ethereal but are ultimately bottom line. The policies that support self-esteem are also the policies that make money. The policies that demean self-esteem are the policies that sooner or later cause a company to lose money—simply because, when you treat people badly and disrespectfully, you cannot possibly hope to get their best. And in today’s fiercely competitive, rapidly changing global economy, nothing less than their best is good enough.</p>
