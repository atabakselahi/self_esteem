<p class="calibre22">I have a friend in his late sixties who is one of the most brilliant and sought-after business speakers in the country. A few years ago he reconnected with a woman he had known and loved many years earlier, with whom he had been out of touch for three decades. She, too, was now in her sixties. They fell passionately in love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Telling me about it one evening at dinner, my friend had never looked happier. It was wonderful to be with him and to see the look of rapture on his face. Thinking, perhaps, of the two divorces in his past, he said, wistfully and urgently, “God, I hope I handle things right this time. I want this relationship to succeed so much. I wish, I mean I want—I hope—you know, that I don’t screw up.” I was silent and he asked, “Got any advice?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, yes, I do,” I answered. “If you want it to work, you must make it your <em class="calibre23">conscious purpose</em> that it work.” He leaned forward intently, and I went on. “I can just imagine what your reaction would be if you were at IBM and some executive said, ‘Gee, I <em class="calibre23">hope</em> we handle the marketing of this new product properly. I really want us to succeed with this, and I wish—’ You’d be all over him in a minute saying, ‘What is this <em class="calibre23">hope</em> stuff? What do you mean, you <em class="calibre23">wish</em>?’ My advice is, apply what you know about the importance of purpose—and action plans—to your personal life. And leave ‘hoping’ and ‘wishing’ for children.”</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">His elated smile said eloquently that he understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This leads me to the subject of living purposefully.</p>
<p class="calibre24">To live without purpose is to live at the mercy of chance—the chance event, the chance phone call, the chance encounter—because we have no standard by which to judge what is or is not worth doing. Outside forces bounce us along, like a cork floating on water, with no initiative of our own to set a specific course. Our orientation to life is reactive rather than proactive. We are drifters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To live purposefully is to use our powers for the attainment of goals we have selected: the goal of studying, of raising a family, of earning a living, of starting a new business, of bringing a new product into the marketplace, of solving a scientific problem, of building a vacation home, of sustaining a happy romantic relationship. It is our goals that lead us forward, that call on the exercise of our faculties, that energize our existence.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Productivity and Purpose</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">To live purposefully is, among other things, to live productively, which is a necessity of making ourselves competent to life. Productivity is the act of supporting our existence by translating our thoughts into reality, of setting our goals and working for their achievement, of bringing knowledge, goods, or services into existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Self-responsible men and women do not pass to others the burden of supporting their existence. It is not the degree of a person’s productive ability that matters here but the person’s choice to exercise such ability as he or she possesses. Nor is it the kind of work selected that is important, provided the work is not intrinsically antilife, but whether a person seeks work that offers an outlet for his or her intelligence, if the opportunity to do so exists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Purposeful men and women set productive goals commensurate with their abilities, or try to. One of the ways their self-concept reveals itself is in the kind of purposes they set. Granted some deciphering may be necessary because of the complexities of private contexts, if we know the kind of goals people choose, we can know a good deal about their vision of themselves and about what they think is possible and appropriate to them.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Efficacy and Purpose</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If self-esteem entails a basic experience of competence (or efficacy), what is the relationship of that competence to narrower, more localized areas of competence in particular areas?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">We build our sense of fundamental efficacy through the mastery of particular forms of efficacy related to the attainment of particular tasks</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fundamental efficacy cannot be generated in a vacuum; it must be created and expressed through some specific tasks successfully mastered. It is not that achievements “prove” our worth but rather that the process of achieving is the means by which we develop our effectiveness, our competence at living. I cannot be efficacious in the abstract without being efficacious about anything in particular. So, productive work has the potential of being a powerful self-esteem-building activity.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">It is easier for people to understand these ideas as applied to work than to personal relationships. That may be why more people make a success of their work life than of their marriages</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The purposes that move us need to be specific if they are to be realized. I cannot organize my behavior optimally if my goal is merely “to do my best.” The assignment is too vague. My goal needs to be: to exercise on the treadmill for thirty minutes four times a week; to complete my (precisely defined) task within ten days; to communicate to my team at our next meeting exactly what the project requires; to earn a specific sum of money in commissions by the end of the year; to achieve a specific market niche by a specific means by a specific target date. With such specificity, I am able to monitor my progress, compare intentions with results, modify my strategy or my tactics in response to new information, and be accountable for the results I produce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To live purposefully is to be concerned with these questions: What am I trying to achieve? How am I trying to achieve it? Why do I think these means are appropriate? Does the feedback from the environment convey that I am succeeding or failing? Is there new information that I <a></a>need to consider? Do I need to make adjustments in my course, or in my strategy, or in my practices? Do my goals and purposes need to be rethought? Thus, to live purposefully means to live at a high level of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is easier for people to understand these ideas as applied to work than to personal relationships. That may be why more people make a success of their work life than of their marriages. Everyone knows it is not enough to say “I love my work.” One must show up at the office and do something. Otherwise, the business moves toward nonexistence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In intimate relationships, however, it is easy to imagine that “love” is enough, that happiness will just come, and if it doesn’t, this means we are wrong for each other. People rarely ask themselves, “If my goal is to have a successful relationship, what must I do? What actions are needed to create and sustain trust, intimacy, continuing self-disclosure, excitement, growth?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a couple is newly married and very happy, it is useful to ask, “What is your action plan to sustain these feelings?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a couple is in conflict and professes a desire for resolution, it is useful to ask, “If restored harmony is your purpose, what actions are you prepared to take to bring it about? What actions do you desire from your partner? What do you see each of you doing to make things better?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Purposes unrelated to a plan of action do not get realized. They exist only as frustrated yearnings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daydreams do not produce the experience of efficacy.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Self-Discipline</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">To live purposefully and productively requires that we cultivate within ourselves a capacity for self-discipline. Self-discipline is the ability to organize our behavior over time in the service of specific tasks. No one can feel competent to cope with the challenges of life who is without the capacity for self-discipline. Self-discipline requires the ability to defer immediate gratification in the service of a remote goal. This is the ability to project consequences into the future—to think, plan, and live long-range. Neither an individual nor a business can function effectively, let alone flourish, in the absence of this practice.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Like all virtues or practices that support self-esteem, self-discipline is a survival virtue—meaning that for human beings it is a requirement of the successful life process. One of the challenges of effective parenthood or effective teaching is to communicate a respect for the present that does not disregard the future, and a respect for the future that does not disregard the present. To master this balance is a challenge to all of us. It is essential if we are to enjoy the sense of being in control of our existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps I should mention that a purposeful, self-disciplined life does not mean a life without time or space for rest, relaxation, recreation, random or even frivolous activity. It merely means that such activities are chosen consciously, with the knowledge that it is safe and appropriate to engage in them. And in any event, the temporary abandonment of purpose also serves a purpose, whether consciously intended or not: that of regeneration.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">What Living Purposefully Entails</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As a way of operating in the world, the practice of living purposefully entails the following core issues.</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Taking responsibility for formulating one’s goals and purposes consciously.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being concerned to identify the actions necessary to achieve one’s goals.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Monitoring behavior to check that it is in alignment with one’s goals.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Paying attention to the outcomes of one’s actions, to know whether they are leading where one wants to go.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Taking responsibility for formulating one’s goals and purposes consciously</em></strong>. If we are to be in control of our own life, we need to know what we want and where we wish to go. We need to be concerned with such questions as: What do I want for myself in five, ten, twenty years? What do I want my life to add up to? What do I want to accomplish professionally? What do I want in the area of personal relationships? If I wish to marry, why? What is my purpose? Within the context of a particular relationship, what are my goals? In relating to <a></a>my children, what are my goals? If I have intellectual or spiritual aspirations, what are they? Are my goals clearly in focus or are they vague and indefinable?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being concerned to identify the actions necessary to achieve one’s goals</em></strong>. If our purposes are to be purposes and not daydreams, we need to ask: How do I get there from here? What actions are necessary? What subpurposes must be accomplished on the way to my ultimate purpose? If new knowledge is required, how will I obtain it? If new resources are needed, how will I acquire them? If our goals are long-range ones, action plans will almost certainly entail subaction plans—that is, plans for the attainment of subpurposes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do we take responsibility for thinking these steps out?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Success in life belongs to those who do.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Monitoring behavior to check that it is in alignment with one’s goals</em></strong>. We can have clearly defined purposes and a reasonable action plan but drift off course by distractions, the emergence of unanticipated problems, the pull of other values, an unconscious reordering of priorities, lack of adequate mental focus, or resistance to doing what one has committed oneself to do. A conscious policy of monitoring actions relative to stated purposes helps us to manage problems of this kind. Sometimes the solution will be to rededicate ourselves to our original intentions. Sometimes we will need to rethink what our most important goals actually are and perhaps reformulate our purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Paying attention to the outcomes of one’s actions, to know whether they are leading where one wants to go</em></strong>. Our goals may be clear and our actions congruent, but our initial calculations about the right steps to take may prove incorrect. Perhaps there were facts we failed to consider. Perhaps developments have changed the context. So we need to keep asking: Are my strategy and tactics working? Am I getting where I want to go? Are my actions producing the results I anticipated?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We often see people in business failing this principle by blindly reciting, “But what we are doing always worked in the past.” In a dynamic economy, yesterday’s strategy and tactics are not necessarily adaptive today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An example: Decades before the problems at General Motors became apparent to everyone, when the company was still at the height of its success, management consultant Peter Drucker warned that the policies that had worked well in the past would not be adaptive in the years to come and that General Motors was moving toward a crisis if it did not <a></a>rethink its policies. He was met with ridicule and hostility by GM executives. Yet reality vindicated his analysis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our actions may fail to produce the consequences we intend, and they also may produce other consequences we did not foresee and do not want. They may work at one level and yet be undesirable at another. For example, incessant nagging and shouting may achieve short-term acquiescence while evoking long-term resentment and rebelliousness. A company may win quick profits by selling shoddy goods and destroy the business within a year as customers drift away. If we pay attention to outcomes, we are able to know not only whether we are achieving our goals but also what we might be achieving that we never intended and may not like.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, living purposefully entails living consciously.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Thinking Clearly About Purposeful Living</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">1</strong>. As an example of the confusions that can surround the issue of living purposefully, consider the extraordinary statement made by psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom in his <em class="calibre23">Existential Psychotherapy</em>. He writes, “The belief that life is incomplete without goal fulfillment is not so much a tragic existential fact of life as it is a Western myth, a cultural artifact.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there is anything we know it is that life is <em class="calibre23">impossible</em> without “goal fulfillment”—impossible on every level of evolution, from the amoeba to the human being. It is neither “a tragic existential fact” nor a “Western myth” but rather the simple nature of life—and often exhilarating.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The root of our self-esteem is not our achievements but those internally generated practices that, among other things, make it possible for us to achieve</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As a life orientation, the alternative to “goal fulfillment” is passivity and aimlessness. Is it a tragedy that such a state does not yield a joy equal to the joys of achievement?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Incidentally, let us remember that “goal fulfillment” is not confined to “worldly” goals. A life of study or meditation has its own kind of <a></a>purposefulness—or it can have. But a life without purpose can hardly be said to be human.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">2</strong>. To observe that the practice of living purposefully is essential to fully realized self-esteem should not be understood to mean that the measure of an individual’s worth is his or her external achievements. We admire achievements—in others and in ourselves—and it is natural and appropriate for us to do so. But this is not the same thing as saying that our achievements are the measure or grounds of our self-esteem. The root of our self-esteem is not our achievements but those internally generated practices that, among other things, <em class="calibre23">make it possible for us to achieve</em>—all the self-esteem virtues we are discussing here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Steel industrialist Andrew Carnegie once stated, “You can take away our factories, take away our trade, our avenues of transportation and our money—leave us with nothing but our organization—and in four years we could reestablish ourselves.” His point was that power lies in the source of wealth, not in the wealth; in the cause, not the effect. The same principle applies to the relationship between self-esteem and external achievements.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">3</strong>. Productive achievement may be an expression of high self-esteem, but it is not its primary cause. A person who is brilliantly talented and successful at work but irrational and irresponsible in his or her private life may <em class="calibre23">want</em> to believe that the sole criterion of virtue is productive performance and that no other sphere of action has moral or self-esteem significance. Such a person may hide behind work in order to evade feelings of shame and guilt stemming from other areas of life (or from painful childhood experiences), so that productive work becomes not so much a healthy passion as an avoidance strategy, a refuge from realities one feels frightened to face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, if a person makes the error of identifying self with his work (rather than with the internal virtues that make the work possible), if self-esteem is tied primarily to accomplishments, success, income, or being a good family provider, the danger is that economic circumstances beyond the individual’s control may lead to the failure of the business or the loss of a job, flinging him into depression or acute demoralization. When a large airplane company closed a plant in one town, the suicide hot lines went crazy. (This problem is primarily one for males, who have been socialized to identify worth—and masculinity—with being a family’s provider. Women are less prone to identify personal worth—let alone femininity—with earning ability.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some years ago, lecturing on this subject in Detroit, with members <a></a>of the automotive industry in the audience, I made the following observation: “Right now Washington is trying to decide whether to bail out Chrysler by guaranteeing a large loan. Never mind for the moment whether you think that’s an appropriate government function; I don’t think it is, but that’s irrelevant. The point is, if you work for Chrysler and tie your self-esteem to being a high achiever in that company or to earning a good income this year, then what that means practically is that you are willing for some persons in Washington literally to hold your soul in their hands, to have total control over your sense of worth. Does that idea offend you? I hope so. It offends me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is bad enough, during economic hard times, to have to worry about money and our family’s welfare and future, but it is still worse if we allow our self-esteem to become undermined in the process—by telling ourselves, in effect, that our efficacy and worth are a function of our earnings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On occasion I have counseled older men and women who found themselves unemployed, passed over in favor of people a good deal younger who were in no way better equipped, or even as well equipped, for the particular job. I have also worked with highly talented young people who suffered from a reverse form of the same prejudice, a discrimination against youth in favor of age—where, again, objective competence and ability were not the standard. In such circumstances, often those involved suffer a feeling of loss of personal effectiveness. Such a feeling is only a hairline away from a sense of diminished self-esteem—and often turns into it. It takes an unusual kind of person to avoid falling into the trap of this error. It takes a person who is already well centered and who understands that some of the forces operating are beyond personal control and, strictly speaking, do not have (or should not have) significance for self-esteem. It is not that they may not suffer or feel anxiety for the future; it is that they do not interpret the problem in terms of personal worth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a question of self-esteem is involved, the question to ask is: Is this matter within my direct, volitional control? Or is it at least linked by a direct line of causality to matters within my direct, volitional control? If it isn’t, it is irrelevant to self-esteem and should be perceived to be, however painful or even devastating the problem may be on other grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day the teaching of this principle will be included in parents’ understanding of proper child-rearing. One day it will be taught in the schools.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">4</strong>. I asked a friend of mine, a businessman approaching sixty, what goals he had for the rest of his life. He answered, “I don’t have any goals. All my life I’ve lived for the future, at the sacrifice of the present. I rarely stopped to enjoy my family or physical nature or any of the beautiful things the world has to offer. Now I don’t think or plan ahead. I still manage my money, of course, and do occasional deals. But my primary goal is to enjoy life each day—to appreciate fully everything I can. In that sense I suppose you could say I’m still living purposefully.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It sounded, I told him, as if he had never learned how to balance projecting goals into the future with appreciating and living in the present. “That’s always been a problem for me,” he agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we have seen, this is not what living purposefully means or entails. It is appropriate to be blind neither to the future nor the present, but to integrate both into our experience and perceptions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the extent that our goal is to “prove” ourselves or to ward off the fear of failure, this balance is difficult to achieve. We are too driven. Not joy but anxiety is our motor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if our aim is self-expression rather than self-justification, the balance tends to come more naturally. We will still need to think about its daily implementation, but the anxiety of wounded self-esteem will not make the task nearly impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      <strong class="calibre6">Examples</strong></p>
<p class="calibre41">      All his life Jack dreamed of being a writer. He pictured himself at his typewriter, he visualized a growing stack of completed chapters, he saw his picture on the cover of <em class="calibre23">Time</em>. However, he was vague on what he wanted to write about. He could not have said what he wished to express. This did not disturb his pleasant reveries. He never thought about how to go about learning to write. In fact, he did not write. He merely daydreamed about writing. He drifted from one low-income job to another, telling himself he did not wish to be tied down or distracted, since his “real” profession was writing. The years went by and life seemed emptier and emptier. His fear of beginning to write escalated because now, by forty, he felt surely he should have begun. “Someday,” he said. “When I’m ready.” Looking at people around him, he told himself how mundane their lives were compared to his <a></a>own. “They have no great visions,” he thought. “No great dreams. My aspirations are so much higher than theirs.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Mary was an executive in an advertising agency. Her primary responsibilities were in marketing—developing new accounts. But she was a compassionate person, and she greatly enjoyed being helpful to those around her. She encouraged associates to drop into her office and talk about their problems; not only office problems but also personal ones. She enjoyed jokes to the effect that she was the “office shrink.” She did not notice that a large amount of her time was drained in activities for which she had not been hired. She became agitated when her performance appraisal reflected dissatisfaction with her work. Yet she found it difficult to change her pattern; the ego-gratification of “helping others” had become addictive. Consequently, there was a poor match between her conscious work goals and her behavior—between her professed purposes and the allocation of her time. A goal she had not chosen consciously took precedence over one she had chosen consciously. Since she did not practice the discipline of monitoring her actions for just such a possibility, the full reality of her lapse did not penetrate her awareness—until she was fired.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Mark wanted to be an effective father. He wanted to teach his son self-respect and self-responsibility. He thought that a good way to achieve this was by lecturing to his son. He did not notice that the more he lectured the more intimidated and uncertain his son became. When the boy showed any kind of fear, the father said, “Don’t be afraid!” When his son began to hide his feelings to avoid reproaches, the father said, “Speak up! If you’ve got something to say, say it!” As the son kept more and more to himself, the father said, “A real man participates in life!” The father wondered, “What’s the matter with that boy? Why won’t he ever listen to me?” In business, if the father tried something and it didn’t work, he tried something else. He did not blame his customers or the universe; he looked for what he might do that would be more effective. He paid attention to the outcomes of his actions. At home, however, when neither lectures nor reproaches nor shouting worked, he did them more often and intensely. In this context he did not think of tracking the outcomes of his actions. What he knew in the professional realm he had forgotten in the personal: Doing more of what doesn’t work doesn’t work.</p>

<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Personal Examples</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When I think of what living purposefully means in my life, I think first of taking responsibility for generating the actions necessary to achieve my goals. Living purposefully overlaps significantly with self-responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think of a time when I wanted something I could not afford that represented a significant improvement in my way of living. A fairly large expenditure of money was involved. For several years I remained uncharacteristically passive about finding a solution. Then one day I had a thought that certainly was not new to me and yet somehow had fresh impact: If I don’t do something, nothing is going to change. This jolted me out of my procrastination, of which I had been dimly aware for a long time but had not confronted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I proceeded to conceive and implement a project that was stimulating, challenging, profoundly satisfying and worthwhile—and that produced the additional income I needed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In principle, I could have done it several years earlier. Only when I became bored and irritated with my own procrastination; only when I decided, “I commit myself to finding a solution over the next few weeks”; only when I applied what I know about living purposefully to my own situation—only then did I launch myself into action and toward a solution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I did, I noticed that not only was I happier but also that my self-esteem rose.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">If I don’t do something, nothing is going to change</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When I told this story in one of my self-esteem groups, I was challenged by someone who said, “That’s okay for you. But not everyone is in a position to develop new projects. What are we to do?” I invited him to talk about his own procrastination and about the unfulfilled desire involved. “If you made it your <em class="calibre23">conscious purpose to</em> achieve that desire,” I asked, “what might you do?” After a bit of good-natured prompting, he began to tell me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is another personal example that involves self-discipline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My wife, Devers, is exceptional in the degree of her benevolence, generosity, and kindness to other human beings and, above all, to <a></a>me. Her consciousness—and consistency—in this aspect of life is very high. While my intentions have generally been good, I have never had her discipline in this area. My generosity has been more impulsive. This means that at times I could be unkind and uncompassionate without intention and without realizing it, simply from preoccupation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, Devers said something that impressed me profoundly. “You are very kind, generous, and caring—when you stop long enough in what you are doing for it to occur to you. What you have never learned is <em class="calibre23">the discipline of kindness</em>. This means kindness that is not a matter of mood or convenience. It means kindness as a basic way of functioning. It is in you as a potential, but it doesn’t happen without consciousness and discipline, which perhaps you’ve never thought about.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">We had versions of this discussion more than once. An important step of my growth was when I integrated those discussions to the principle of living purposefully—<em class="calibre23">so that kindness became not merely an inclination but a conscious goal</em>.</p>
