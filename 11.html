<p class="calibre22">As we mature and develop our own values and standards (or absorb them from others), the issue of personal integrity assumes increasing importance in our self-assessment.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Integrity</em> is the integration of ideals, convictions, standards, beliefs—and behavior. When our behavior is congruent with our professed values, when ideals and practice match, we have integrity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Observe that before the issue of integrity can even be raised we need principles of behavior—moral convictions about what is and is not appropriate—judgments about right and wrong action. If we do not yet hold standards, we are on too low a developmental rung even to be accused of hypocrisy. In such a case, our problems are too severe to be described merely as lack of integrity. Integrity arises as an issue only for those who profess standards and values, which, of course, is the great majority of human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we behave in ways that conflict with our judgment of what is appropriate, we lose face in our own eyes. We respect ourselves less. If the policy becomes habitual, we trust ourselves less or cease to trust ourselves at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, we do not forfeit the right to practice self-acceptance in the basic sense discussed earlier; we have noted that self-acceptance is a precondition of change or improvement. But self-esteem necessarily suffers. <a></a>When a breach of integrity wounds self-esteem, only the practice of integrity can heal it.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">When we behave in ways that conflict with our judgment of what is appropriate, we lose face in our own eyes</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">At the simplest level, personal integrity entails such questions as: Am I honest, reliable, and trustworthy? Do I keep my promises? Do I do the things I say I admire and do I avoid the things I say I deplore? Am I fair and just in my dealings with others?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes we may find ourselves caught in a conflict between different values that clash in a particular context, and the solution may be far from self-evident. Integrity does not guarantee that we will make the best choice; it only asks that our effort to find the best choice be authentic—that we <em class="calibre23">stay conscious</em>, stay connected with our knowledge, call on our best rational clarity, take responsibility for our choice and its consequences, do not seek to escape into mental fog.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Congruence</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Integrity means congruence. Words and behavior match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are people we know whom we trust and others we do not. If we ask ourselves the reason, we will see that congruence is basic. We trust congruency and are suspicious of incongruency.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Studies disclose that many people in organizations do not trust those above them. Why? Lack of congruence. Beautiful mission statements unsupported by practice. The doctrine of respect for the individual disgraced in action. Slogans about customer service on the walls unmatched by the realities of daily business. Sermons about honesty mocked by cheating. Promises of fairness betrayed by favoritism.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In most organizations, however, there are men and woman whom others trust. Why? They keep their word. They honor their commitments. They don’t just promise to stick up for their people, they do it. They just don’t preach fairness, they practice it. They don’t just counsel honesty and integrity, they live it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave a group of executives this sentence stem: <strong class="calibre6">If I want people to <a></a>perceive me as trustworthy—</strong>. Here are typical endings: <em class="calibre23">“I must keep my word”; “I must be evenhanded in my dealings with everyone”; “I must walk my talk”; “I must follow through on my commitments”; “I must look after my people against the higher-ups”; “I must be consistent</em>.” To any executive who wishes to be perceived as trustworthy, there is no mystery about what is required.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are parents whom their children trust and there are parents whom their children do not trust. Why? The principle is the same as above: congruence. Children may not be able to articulate what they know, but they know.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">When We Betray Our Standards</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">To understand why lapses of integrity are detrimental to self-esteem, consider what a lapse of integrity entails. If I act in contradiction to a moral value held by someone else but not by me, I may or may not be wrong, but I cannot be faulted for having betrayed my convictions. If, however, I act against what I myself regard as right, if my actions clash with my expressed values, then <em class="calibre23">I act against my judgment, I betray my mind</em>. Hypocrisy, by its very nature, is self-invalidating. It is mind rejecting itself. A default on integrity undermines me and contaminates my sense of self. It damages me as no external rebuke or rejection can damage me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I give sermons on honesty to my children yet lie to my friends and neighbors; if I become righteous and indignant when people do not keep their commitments to me but disregard my commitments to others; if I preach a concern with quality but indifferently sell my customers shoddy goods; if I unload bonds I know to be falling in value to a client who trusts my honor; if I pretend to care about my staff’s ideas when my mind is already made up; if I outmaneuver a colleague in the office and appropriate her achievements; if I ask for honest feedback and penalize the employee who disagrees with me; if I ask for pay sacrifices from others on the grounds of hard times and then give myself a gigantic bonus—I may evade my hypocrisy, I may produce any number of rationalizations, but the fact remains I launch an assault on my self-respect that no rationalization will dispel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I am uniquely situated to raise my self-esteem, I am also uniquely situated to lower it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the great self-deceptions is to tell oneself, “Only I will know.” <a></a>Only I will know I am a liar; only I will know I deal unethically with people who trust me; only I will know I have no intention of honoring my promise. The implication is that <em class="calibre23">my judgment is unimportant and that only the judgment of others counts</em>. But when it comes to matters of self-esteem, I have more to fear from my own judgment than from anyone else’s. In the inner courtroom of my mind, <em class="calibre23">mine is the only judgment that counts</em>. My ego, the “I” at the center of my consciousness, is the judge from whom there is no escape. I can avoid people who have learned the humiliating truth about me. I cannot avoid myself.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Most of the issues of integrity we face are not big issues but small ones, yet the accumulated weight of our choices has an impact on our sense of self</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I recall a news article I read some years ago about a medical researcher of high repute who was discovered to have been faking his data for a long time while piling up grant after grant and honor after honor. There was no way for self-esteem not to be a casualty of such behavior, even before the fakery was revealed. He knowingly chose to live in a world of unreality, where his achievements and prestige were equally unreal. Long before others knew, <em class="calibre23">he</em> knew. Impostors of this kind, who live for an illusion in someone else’s mind, which they hold as more important than their own knowledge of the truth, do not enjoy good self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the issues of integrity we face are not big issues but small ones, yet the accumulated weight of our choices has an impact on our sense of self. I conduct weekly ongoing “self-esteem groups” for people who have come together for a specific purpose, to grow in self-efficacy and self-respect, and one evening I gave the group this sentence stem: <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity into my life—</strong>. As we went around the circle, here are the endings that were expressed:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity into my life—</strong></p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      I’d tell people when they do things that bother me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t pad my expense account.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be truthful with my husband about what my clothes cost.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d tell my parents I don’t believe in God.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d admit it when I’m flirting.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t be so ingratiating to people I dislike.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t laugh at jokes I think stupid and vulgar.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d put in more of an effort at work.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d help my wife more with chores, as I promised.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d tell customers the truth about what they’re buying.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t just say what people want to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t sell my soul to be popular.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d say no when I want to say no.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would acknowledge my responsibility to people I’ve hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d make amends.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d keep my promises.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t pretend agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t deny it when I’m angry.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d make more of an effort to be fair and not just fly off the handle.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d admit it when others have helped me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d admit it to my children when I know I’m wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t take supplies home from the office.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The ease and speed of people’s responses point to the fact that these matters are not very far beneath the surface of awareness, although there is understandable motivation to evade them. (One of the reasons I find sentence-completion work so useful is its power to bypass most blocks and avoidances.) A tragedy of many lives is that people greatly underestimate the self-esteem costs and consequences of hypocrisy and dishonesty. They imagine that at worst all that is involved is some discomfort. But it is the spirit itself that is contaminated.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Dealing with Guilt</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The essence of guilt, whether major or minor, is moral self-reproach. I did wrong when it was possible for me to do otherwise. Guilt always carries the implication of choice and responsibility, whether or not we are consciously aware of it. For this reason, it is imperative that <a></a>we be clear on what is and is not in our power—what is and is not a breach of integrity. Otherwise, we run the risk of accepting guilt inappropriately.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The idea of Original Sin is anti-self-esteem by its very nature</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">For example, suppose someone we love—a husband, a wife, a child—is killed in an accident. Even though we may know the thought is irrational, we may tell ourselves, “Somehow I should have prevented it.” Perhaps this guilt is fed in part by our regrets over actions taken or not taken while the person was alive. In the case of deaths that seem senseless, such as when a person is hit by a careless automobile driver or dies during minor surgery, the survivor may experience an unbearable feeling of being out of control, of being at the mercy of an event that has no rational significance. Then self-blame or self-reproach can ameliorate the anguish, can diminish a sense of impotence. The survivor feels, “If only I had done such and such differently, this terrible accident would not have occurred.” Thus, “guilt” can serve the desire for efficacy by providing an <em class="calibre23">illusion</em> of efficacy. We see the same principle when children blame themselves for their parents’ wrongdoing. (“If I weren’t bad, Daddy wouldn’t have hit Mommy.” “If I weren’t bad, Mommy wouldn’t have gotten drunk and set the house on fire.”) This problem is examined in <em class="calibre23">Honoring the Self</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The protection of self-esteem requires a clear understanding of the limits of personal responsibility. Where there is no power, there can be no responsibility, and where there is no responsibility, there can be no reasonable self-reproach. Regret, yes; guilt, no.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The idea of Original Sin—of guilt where there is no possibility of innocence, no freedom of choice, no alternatives available—is anti-self-esteem by its very nature. The very notion of guilt without volition or responsibility is an assault on reason as well as on morality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us think about guilt and how it can be resolved in situations where we <em class="calibre23">are</em> personally responsible. Generally speaking, five steps are needed to restore one’s sense of integrity with regard to a particular breach.</p>
<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">1</strong>.   We must own the fact that it is we who have taken the particular action. We must face and accept the full reality of what we have <a></a>done, without disowning or avoidance. We own, we accept, we take responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">2</strong>.   We seek to understand why we did what we did. We do this compassionately (as discussed under the practice of self-acceptance), but without evasive alibiing.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">3</strong>.   If others are involved, as they often are, we acknowledge explicitly to the relevant person or persons the harm we have done. We convey our understanding of the consequences of our behavior. We acknowledge how they have been affected by us. We convey understanding of their feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">4</strong>.   We take any and all actions available that might make amends for or minimize the harm we have done.</p>
<p class="calibre35">     <strong class="calibre6">5</strong>.   We firmly commit ourselves to behaving differently in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre36">Without all these steps, we may continue to feel guilty over some wrong behavior, even though it happened years ago, even though our psychotherapist might have told us everyone makes mistakes, and even though the wronged person may have offered forgiveness. None of that may be enough; self-esteem remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes we try to make amends without ever owning or facing what we have done. Or we keep saying “I’m sorry.” Or we go out of our way to be nice to the person we have wronged without ever addressing the wrong explicitly. Or we ignore the fact that there are specific actions we could take to undo the harm we have caused. Sometimes, of course, there is no way to undo the harm, and we must accept and make our peace with that; we cannot do more than what is possible. But if we do not do what is possible and appropriate, guilt tends to linger on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When guilt is a consequence of failed integrity, nothing less than an act of integrity can redress the breach.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">What If Our Values Are Irrational?</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">While it is easy enough to recognize at a commonsense level the relationship between self-esteem and integrity, the issue of living up to our standards is not always simple. What if our standards are irrational or mistaken?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We may accept or absorb a code of values that does violence to our nature and needs. For example, certain religious teachings implicitly or explicitly damn sex, damn pleasure, damn the body, damn ambition, <a></a>damn material success, damn (for all practical purposes) the enjoyment of life on earth. If children are indoctrinated with these teachings, what will the practice of “integrity” mean in their lives? Some elements of “hypocrisy” may be all that keeps them alive.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Once we see that living up to our standards appears to be leading us toward self-destruction, the time has come to question our standards</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Once we see that living up to our standards appears to be leading us toward self-destruction, the time has come to question our standards rather than simply resigning ourselves to living without integrity. We must summon the courage to challenge some of our deepest assumptions concerning what we have been taught to regard as the good. That courage may be needed is evident in the following sentence completions commonly heard in my therapy practice. Any psychotherapist who cares to experiment with these stems can discover for him- or herself how typical these endings are.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">At the thought of going against my parents’ values</strong>—</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      I feel frightened.</p>

<p class="calibre41">      Is this what grown-ups do?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d need an awful lot of nerve.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Wouldn’t that be arrogant?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d have to stand on my own feet.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I couldn’t be Daddy’s little girl anymore.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As examples of the confusion and conflict about what the practice of integrity might mean in daily living, I offer the following:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Women who struggle with the moral dilemmas created by the Catholic church’s prohibition of birth control devices and abortion.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Employees in government agencies who, appalled by the magnitude of bureaucratic corruption among colleagues and superiors, feel themselves caught in conflict between their notion of patriotism and good citizenship on the one hand and the demands of individual conscience on the other.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Hard-working, ambitious businessmen who had been encouraged at the start of their careers to be productive and industrious but who, when they finally committed the sin of succeeding, were confronted with the disorienting biblical pronouncement that it shall be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Wives who sense that the traditional view of woman-as-servant-to-man is a morality of self-annihilation.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Young men struggling with the dilemma of complying with or fleeing from military conscription.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Former nuns and priests disenchanted with the religious institutions to which they had given their allegiance and striving to define their values outside the context of a tradition they can no longer accept.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Rabbis or former rabbis with precisely the same problem.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Young persons rebelling against the values of their parents and not knowing what vision of the good to live by instead.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In such conflicts we see how essential are other practices, such as living consciously and self-responsibly, to integrity. We cannot practice integrity in an intellectual vacuum.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">To resolve any of the conflicts listed above, or countless others like them, one would have to rethink one’s deepest values, commitments, and priorities—or perhaps think about them for the first time—and be willing, if necessary, to challenge any and all authorities.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">One of the most positive aspects of the women’s movement is its insistence that women think for themselves about who they are and what they want.

<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">One area in which living consciously and integrity clearly intersect is in the need to reflect on the values we have been taught, the shared assumptions of our family or culture, the roles we may have been assigned—and to question whether they fit our own perceptions and understanding, or whether they do violence to the deepest and best within us, to what is sometimes called “our true nature.” One of the most positive aspects of the women’s movement, as I see it, is its insistence that women think for themselves about who they are, what is possible and appropriate to them, and what they want (not what someone else wants them to want). But men need to learn this kind of independent thinking as much as women do. One of the penalties for living unconsciously—for both sexes—is that of enduring unrewarding lives in the service of self-stultifying ends never examined or chosen with awareness by the individuals involved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The higher the level of consciousness at which we operate, the more we live by explicit <em class="calibre23">choice</em> and the more naturally does integrity follow as a consequence.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Discussing the complexities of moral decision making in a lecture once, I was asked what I thought of Joseph Campbell’s counsel to “Follow your own bliss.” Did I believe it was ethically appropriate? I answered that while I liked what I believed to be Campbell’s basic intention, his statement could be dangerous if divorced from a rational context. I suggested this modification (if I were forced to condense my <a></a>ideas on morality into a single sentence): “Live consciously—take responsibility for your choices and actions—respect the rights of others—and follow your own bliss.” I added that as a piece of moral advice I loved the Spanish proverb “ ‘Take what you want,’ said God, ‘and pay for it.’ ” But of course complex moral decisions cannot be made simply on the basis of statements such as these, helpful though they may sometimes be. A moral life requires serious reflection.</p>

He listens emphatically when his friend calls him—sometimes in the middle of the night—to talk for hours about his personal and professional troubles. Philip’s feelings of self-worth are nurtured by the intimacies this famous man shares with him. When he is with his other friends, Philip can not resist dropping remarks from time to time that stress the closeness of their connection. “I know millions of women adore him, but you’d be surprised at how insecure he is. He’s always asking, ‘Is it me they want, or my fame?’” “He has this awful feeling of being an impostor. Isn’t that sad? He’s such a wonderful person.” “Sometimes—this is confidential, of course—he has trouble maintaining his erection.” Philip insists that he loves his friend and is absolutely loyal. What does he tell himself, at three o’clock in the morning, about his dozens of betrayals, generated by his craving for status in the eyes of his other friends? Does he notice that each such betrayal lowers rather than raises his self-esteem? Does he make the connection?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Sally is a member of a book club whose monthly meetings she attends enthusiastically. They support her desire to feel cultured. The chairwoman is a charismatic, highly knowledgeable person whom everyone admires. Most of the women feel proud when she shares their literary assessments. They want to be on her “good side,” because that enhances their feelings of personal worth. One day the chairwoman has a falling out with a member of the club, someone who had been a good friend of Sally’s for years. No one knows what the dispute is about. The chairwoman chooses not to discuss its content except in very general terms. But she arranges for everyone to know that this person, who has dropped out of the club, is <em class="calibre23">persona non grata</em>. Now, no one wants to be known to be talking to her. When the woman <a></a>telephones Sally, eager to discuss her perspective on the conflict, Sally finds an excuse to put her off. She is afraid that if she hears her friend’s position and is moved by it, she will be flung into an impossible conflict. She does not want to lose status with her other friends or with the chairwoman. So she does not return her friend’s phone calls. Inside her mind she begins to find more and more fault with her friend. Soon she is airing her own list of grievances, which she had never spoken of in the past. Her reward is the smile of approval on the chairwoman’s face and their subsequent increased intimacy. She is aware of the reward but not comparably aware of its cost: diminished self-respect.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Until his electronics company begins to suffer from foreign competition, Irving was always an advocate of free trade. He scorned businessmen who sought the aid of government to grant them special privileges, favors, or various forms of protection. “That’s not true capitalism,” he said, correctly. Now he is frightened; he knows his products are not as good as those of his foreign competitors, who keep bringing innovation after innovation into the marketplace. He engages a public relations firm to help him write speeches favoring government restrictions on imports that threaten him. He hires a firm in Washington to lobby for legislation that would protect him. When associates try to point out that protected industries have a history of remaining permanently weak, he brushes their observations aside. He does not want to think about that; consciousness in this area has become irritating. “This is different,” he asserts without explaining how or in what way. When he is told that people should be free to buy the best product available for the money, he answers righteously and irrelevantly, “Capitalism must be tempered by concern for the common good.” When he is challenged with the observation that he buys foreign goods when they are superior to domestic, he answers, “Don’t I have the right to get the best for my money?” When he is invited to give the commencement address at the university from which he graduated, he chooses as his theme “Living with Integrity.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">Many years ago I was married to a woman I was very attached to but no longer loved; my romance with Ayn Rand was fading but not “officially” terminated. Both relationships were painfully unresolved when I met and fell passionately in love with a third woman I would later marry: Patrecia, who would die at the age of thirty-seven. For a long time my mind was a chaos of conflicting loyalties, and I handled things very badly. I did not tell the truth to my wife or to Ayn as soon as I could have—never mind the reasons. “Reasons” do not alter facts.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It was a long road, but at its end was painfully acquired knowledge I had possessed at the beginning—that the truth had to be told and that by procrastinating and delaying I merely made the consequences for everyone more terrible. I succeeded in protecting no one, least of all myself. If part of my motive was to spare people I cared about, I inflicted a worse pain than they would otherwise have experienced. If part of my motive was to protect my self-esteem by avoiding a conflict among my values and loyalties, it was my self-esteem that I damaged. Lies do not work.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Sentence Completions to Facilitate the Practice of Integrity</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we examine our lives, we may notice that our practice of integrity exhibits inconsistencies. There are areas where we practice it more and areas where we practice it less. Rather than evade this fact, it is useful to explore it. It is worthwhile to consider: What stands in the way of my practicing integrity in every area of my life? What would happen if I lived my values consistently?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here are sentence stems that can aid the process of exploration:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">Integrity to me means—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I think about the areas where I find it difficult to practice full integrity—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring a higher level of consciousness to the areas where I find it difficult to practice full integrity—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity into my life—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity to my work—</strong></p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more integrity to my relationships—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I remain loyal to the values I truly believe are right—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I refuse to live by values I do not respect—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I treat my self-esteem as a high priority—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">A suggestion: Work with the first four of these stems for the first week, and the second four the following week. On the weekends work with the stem: <strong class="calibre6">If any of what I am writing is true, it might be helpful if I</strong>—. If you choose to bring a high level of awareness to what you produce, you may discover that living with greater integrity has become more realizable.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Practical Application</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you think padding my expense account is really so awful?” a client asked me. “Everyone does it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I imagine,” I said to him, “that something about it must disturb you or you wouldn’t have brought it up.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve been doing these stems, ‘If I bring 5 percent more integrity into my life,’ and the other day when I began to fill out my expense sheet with padded items, I don’t know, it didn’t feel comfortable, it felt wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Lying gave you a bad feeling,” I remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, so I filled it out truthfully, and then, later, I wondered if I wasn’t a sucker.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You wondered, why be concerned with my integrity if other people aren’t concerned with theirs?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hell, no, if I’d thought about it like that, I’d—” He broke off and stared thoughtfully into space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What you just said is what it all really comes to, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And if so, the question that naturally arises is: Do I take a poll on what I’ll call acceptable behavior?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I think lying about my expenses is <em class="calibre23">wrong!</em>” he said, almost perplexed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, then, what’s the question …?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When I do something I think is wrong, it leaves, you know, a bad taste.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder what policy you’ll adopt for the future.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I feel cleaner when I’m honest.”</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">“So you’re saying, from the perspective of self-esteem, honesty is the best policy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s what it’s looking like.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think that’s a fairly important observation.”</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Keeping Your Integrity in a Corrupt World</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In a world where we regard ourselves and are regarded by others as accountable for our actions, the practice of integrity is relatively easier than in a world where the principle of personal accountability is absent. A culture of accountability tends to support our moral aspirations.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The challenge for people today, and it is not an easy one, is to maintain high personal standards while feeling that one is living in a moral sewer.</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we live in a society where business associates, corporate heads, political figures, religious leaders, and other public personalities hold themselves to high standards of morality, it is relatively easier for an average person to practice integrity than in a society where corruption, cynicism, and amorality are the norm. In the latter kind of society, the individual is likely to feel that the quest for personal integrity is futile and unrealistic—unless he or she is extraordinarily independent and autonomous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The challenge for people today, and it is not an easy one, is to maintain high personal standards while feeling that one is living in a moral sewer. Grounds for such a feeling are to be found in the behavior of our public figures, the horror of world events, and in our so-called art and entertainment, so much of which celebrates depravity, cruelty, and mindless violence. All contribute to making the practice of personal integrity a lonely and heroic undertaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If integrity is a source of self-esteem, then it is also, and never more so than today, an <em class="calibre23">expression</em> of self-esteem.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Principal of Reciprocal Causation</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, this leads to an important question. About all six pillars it might be asked, “To practice them, does one not need already to possess self-esteem? How then can they be the foundation of self-esteem?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In answering, I must introduce what I call <em class="calibre23">the principle of reciprocal causation</em>. By this I mean that behaviors that generate good self-esteem are also expressions of good self-esteem. Living consciously is both a cause and an effect of self-efficacy and self-respect. And so is self-acceptance, self-responsibility, all the other practices I describe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The more I live consciously, the more I trust my mind and respect my worth; and if I trust my mind and respect my worth, it feels natural to live consciously. The more I live with integrity, the more I enjoy good self-esteem; and if I enjoy good self-esteem, it feels natural to live with integrity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another noteworthy aspect of the dynamics involved here is that the practice of these virtues over time tends to generate a felt need for them. If I habitually operate at a high level of consciousness, unclarity and fog in my awareness will make me uncomfortable: I will usually experience a drive to dispel the darkness. If I have made self-responsibility second nature, passivity and dependency will be onerous to me. I will experience internal pressure to reassert the control over my existence possible only with autonomy. If I have been consistent in my integrity, I will experience dishonesty on my part as disturbing and will feel a thrust to resolve the dissonance and restore the inner sense of moral cleanliness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once we understand the practices I have described, we have the power (at least to some extent) to choose them. The power to choose them is the power to raise the level of our self-esteem, from whatever point we may be starting and however difficult the project may be in the early stages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An analogy to physical exercise may be helpful. If we are in poor physical condition, exercise is typically difficult; as our condition improves, exercise becomes easier and more enjoyable. We begin where we are—and build our strength from there. Raising self-esteem follows the same principle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These practices are ideals to guide us. And—this can hardly be overemphasized—they do not have to be lived “perfectly” 100 percent of the time in order to have a beneficent impact on our lives. Small improvements make a difference.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">It might strike the reader, reflecting on this list of self-esteem practices, that they sound very much like a code of ethics—or part of one. That is true. The virtues that self-esteem asks of us are also ones that life asks of us.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">The practice of personal integrity is the sixth pillar of self-esteem.</strong></p>
