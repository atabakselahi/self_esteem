<p class="calibre22">To set my definition of self-esteem in context, I want to comment on a few representative definitions that have been proposed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The “father” of American psychology is William James, and in his <em class="calibre23">Principles of Psychology</em>, originally published in 1890, we find the earliest attempt I know of to define self-esteem:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      I, who for the time have staked my all on being a psychologist, am mortified if others know much more psychology than I. But I am contented to wallow in the grossest ignorance of Greek. My deficiencies there give me no sense of personal humiliation at all. Had I “pretensions” to be a linguist, it would have been just the reverse…. With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-feeling in this world depends entirely on what we <em class="calibre23">back</em> ourselves to be and do. It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities; a fraction of which our pretensions are the denominator and the numerator our success: thus,</p>
<p class="calibre56"><img alt="art" class="calibre57" src="images/00002.jpg"/></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre41">      Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I said in my Introduction that whoever speaks about self-esteem inescapably speaks about himself. The first thing James is telling us <a></a>about himself is that he bases his self-esteem on how well he compares to others in his chosen field. If no one else can match his expertise, his self-esteem is satisfied; if someone else surpasses him, his self-esteem is devastated. He is telling us that in a sense he is placing his self-esteem at the mercy of others. In his professional life, this gives him a vested interest in being surrounded by inferiors; it gives him reason to fear talent rather than welcome, admire, and take pleasure in it. This is not a formula for healthy self-esteem but a prescription for anxiety. To tie our self-esteem to any factor outside our volitional control, such as the choices or actions of others, is to invite anguish. That so many people judge themselves just this way is their tragedy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If “self-esteem equals success divided by pretensions,” then, as James points out, self-esteem can equally be protected by increasing one’s success or lowering one’s pretensions. This means that a person who aspires to nothing, neither in work nor in character, and achieves it, and a person of high accomplishment and high character, are equals in self-esteem. I do not believe that this is an idea at which anyone could have arrived by paying attention to the real world. People with aspirations so low that they meet them mindlessly and effortlessly are not conspicuous for their psychological well-being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How well we live up to our personal standards and values (which James unfortunately calls “pretensions”) clearly has a bearing on our self-esteem. The value of James’s discussion is that it draws attention to this fact. But it is a fact that cannot properly be understood in a vacuum, as if the <em class="calibre23">content</em> of our standards and values were irrelevant and nothing more were involved than the neutral formula James proposes. Literally, his formula is less a definition of self-esteem than a statement concerning how he believes the level of self-esteem is determined not in some unfortunate individuals but in everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the best books written on self-esteem is Stanley Coopersmith’s <em class="calibre23">The Antecedents of Self-Esteem</em>. His research on the contribution of parents remains invaluable. He writes:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      By self-esteem we refer to the evaluation that the individual makes and customarily maintains with regard to himself: it expresses an attitude of approval or disapproval, and indicates the extent to which the individual believes himself to be capable, significant, successful, and worthy. In short, self-esteem is a <em class="calibre23">personal</em> judgment of worthiness that is expressed in the attitudes the individual holds toward himself.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Relative to James, this formulation represents a great step forward. It speaks much more directly to what our experience of self-esteem is. Yet there are questions it raises and leaves unanswered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Capable” of what? All of us are capable in some areas and not in others. Capable relative to whatever we undertake? Then must any lack of adequate competence diminish self-esteem? I do not think Coopersmith would want to suggest this, but the implication is left hanging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Significant”—what does this mean? Significant in what way? Significant in the eyes of others? Which others? Significant by what standards?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Successful”—does this mean worldly success? Financial success? Career success? Social success? Success concerning what? Note he is not saying that self-esteem contains the idea that success (in principle) is <em class="calibre23">appropriate;</em> he is saying that self-esteem contains the idea of <em class="calibre23">seeing oneself as successful</em>—which is entirely different and troublesome in its implications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Worthy”—of what? Happiness? Money? Love? Anything the individual desires? My sense is that Coopersmith would mean by “worthy” pretty much what I spell out above in my own definition, but he does not say so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another definition is offered by Richard L. Bednar, M. Gawain Wells, and Scott R. Peterson in their book <em class="calibre23">Self-Esteem: Paradoxes and Innovations in Clinical Theory and Practice:</em></p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Parenthetically, we define self-esteem as a subjective and enduring sense of realistic self-approval. It reflects how the individual views and values the self at the most fundamental levels of psychological experiencing. … Fundamentally, then, self-esteem is an enduring and affective sense of personal value based on accurate self-perception.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">“Approval”—concerning what? Everything about the self from physical appearance to actions to intellectual functioning? We are not told. “Views and values the self”—concerning what issues or criteria? “An enduring and affective sense of personal value”—<em class="calibre23">what does this mean?</em> One the other hand, what I like in this formulation is the observation that genuine self-esteem is reality based.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the most widely publicized definitions of self-esteem is given in <em class="calibre23">Toward a State of Esteem: The Final Report of the California Task Force to Promote Self and Personal and Social Responsibility:</em></p>
<a></a>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Self-esteem is defined as: “Appreciating my own worth and importance and having the character to be accountable for myself and to act responsibly toward others.”</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In this definition, we find the same lack of specificity as in the other definitions—“worth and importance” <em class="calibre23">concerning what?</em> There is another problem with the task force statement: inserting into the definition what is obviously meant to be a basic <em class="calibre23">source</em> of healthy self-esteem (that is, being accountable for oneself and acting responsibly toward others). A definition of a psychological state is meant to tell us what a state <em class="calibre23">is</em>, not how one gets there. Did the people who offered this definition want us to understand that if we don’t act responsibly toward others we won’t possess healthy self-esteem? If so, they are probably right, but is that part of the definition—or is it a different issue? (Almost certainly such a definition is influenced by “political” rather than scientific considerations—to reassure people that champions of self-esteem are not fostering petty, irresponsible “selfishness.”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, there are those in the self-esteem movement who announce that “self-esteem means ‘I am capable and lovable.’”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again we must ask, “Capable” of what? I am a great skier, a brilliant lawyer, and a first-rate chef. However, I don’t feel competent to assess independently the moral values my mother taught me. I feel, Who am I to know? In such a case, am I “capable”? Do I have self-esteem?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As to “lovable”—yes, feeling lovable is one of the characteristics of healthy self-esteem. So is feeling worthy of happiness and success. Is feeling lovable more important? Evidently, since the other two items are not mentioned. <em class="calibre23">By what reasoning?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">I shall not belabor the point by offering additional examples that would only reflect variations of the same difficulties.</p>
