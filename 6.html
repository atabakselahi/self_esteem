<p class="calibre22">In virtually all of the great spiritual and philosophical traditions of the world there appears some form of the idea that most human beings are sleepwalking through their own existence. Enlightenment is identified with waking up. Evolution and progress are identified with an expansion of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We perceive consciousness as the highest manifestation of life. The higher the form of consciousness, the more advanced the form of life. Moving up the evolutionary ladder from the time consciousness first emerges on the planet, each life-form has a more advanced form of consciousness than that of the life-form on the rung below.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among our own species, we carry this same principle further: We identify increasing maturity with wider vision, greater awareness, higher consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why is consciousness so important? Because for all species that possess it, consciousness is the basic tool of survival—the ability to be aware of the environment in some form, at some level, and to guide action accordingly. I use <em class="calibre23">consciousness</em> here in its primary meaning: the state of being conscious or aware of some aspect of reality. We also may speak of consciousness as a <em class="calibre23">faculty</em>—the attribute of being able to be aware. To the distinctively <em class="calibre23">human</em> form of consciousness, with its capacity for concept formation and abstract thought, we give the name <em class="calibre23">mind</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we have discussed, we are beings for whom consciousness (at the <a></a>conceptual level) is <em class="calibre23">volitional</em>. This means that the design of our nature contains an extraordinary option—that of seeking awareness or not bothering (or actively avoiding it), seeking truth or not bothering (or actively avoiding it), focusing our mind or not bothering (or choosing to drop to a lower level of consciousness). In other words, we have the option of exercising our powers or of subverting our means of survival and well-being. This capacity for self-management is our glory and, at times, our burden.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Our mind is our basic tool of survival. Betray it and self-esteem suffers</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we do not bring an appropriate level of consciousness to our activities, if we do not live mindfully, the inevitable penalty is a diminished sense of self-efficacy and self-respect. We cannot feel competent and worthy while conducting our lives in a mental fog. Our mind is our basic tool of survival. Betray it and self-esteem suffers. The simplest form of this betrayal is the evasion of discomfiting facts. For example:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      “I know I am not giving my job my best, but I don’t want to think about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “I know there are signs our business is falling into worse and worse trouble, but what we’ve done worked in the past, didn’t it? Anyway the whole subject is upsetting, and maybe if I sit tight the situation will resolve itself—<em class="calibre23">somehow</em>.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “‘Legitimate grievances?’ What ‘legitimate grievances?’ My spouse has been influenced by those crazy women’s libbers. That’s why she’s beating up on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “I know my children suffer from having so little of me, I know I am causing hurt and resentment, but one day—<em class="calibre23">somehow</em>—I’ll change.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “What do you mean, I drink too much? I can stop anytime I want.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “I know the way I eat is wrecking my health, but—”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “I know I’m living beyond my means, but—”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      “I know I’m phony and lie about my accomplishments, but—”</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Through the thousands of choices we make between thinking and nonthinking, being responsible toward reality or evading it, we establish a sense of the kind of person we are. Consciously, we rarely remember these choices. But deep in our psyche they are added up, and the sum is that experience we call “self-esteem.” <em class="calibre23">Self-esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are not all equal in intelligence, but intelligence is not the issue. The <em class="calibre23">principle</em> of living consciously is unaffected by degrees of intelligence. <em class="calibre23">To live consciously means to seek to be aware of everything that bears on our actions, purposes, values, and goals</em>—<em class="calibre23">to the best of our ability, whatever that ability may be</em>—<em class="calibre23">and to behave in accordance with that which we see and know</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Betrayal of Consciousness</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">This last point bears emphasis. Consciousness that is not translated into appropriate action is a betrayal of consciousness; it is mind invalidating itself. Living consciously means more than seeing and knowing; it means acting on what one sees and knows. Thus, I can recognize that I have been unfair and hurtful to my child (or my spouse or my friend) and need to make amends. But I don’t want to admit I made a mistake, so I procrastinate, claiming that I am still “thinking” about the situation. This is the opposite of living consciously. At a fundamental level, it is an avoidance of consciousness—avoidance of the meaning of what I am doing; avoidance of my motives; avoidance of my continuing cruelty.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Possible Misunderstandings</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Let me anticipate and address possible misunderstandings about the application of the principle of living consciously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">1. It is in the nature of human learning that we automate new knowledge and skills, such as speaking a language or driving an automobile, so that they do not continue to require of us the level of explicit awareness that was necessary during the learning stage. As mastery is attained, they drop into the accumulated repertoire of the subconscious—thus freeing the conscious mind for the new and unfamiliar. Living consciously does not mean that we retain in explicit awareness everything we ever learned, which would be neither possible nor desirable.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">2. To be operating consciously—to be in appropriate mental focus—does not mean that we must be engaged in some task of problem solving every moment of our waking existence. We may choose to meditate, for example, emptying our mind of all thought to make ourselves available to new possibilities of relaxation, rejuvenation, creativity, insight, or some form of transcendence. This can be an entirely appropriate mental activity—in fact, in some contexts, a highly desirable one. And, of course, there are still other alternatives to problem solving, such as creative daydreaming or abandonment to physical playfulness or erotic sensation. In matters of mental functioning, <em class="calibre23">context determines appropriateness</em>. To operate consciously does not mean always to be in the same mental state <em class="calibre23">but rather to be in the state appropriate to what I am doing</em>. If, for example, I am tumbling on the floor with a child, my mental state will obviously be very different from what it is when I am working on a book. But that I am operating consciously will show up in the fact that no matter how playfully silly I may become, part of my mind is monitoring the situation to see that the child remains physically safe. If, in contrast, I am oblivious to the fact that I am playing too hard and hurting the child, my level of consciousness is inadequate to the situation. The point is that the issue of the appropriateness of my state of consciousness can only be determined relative to my purposes. There is no “right” or “wrong” state in a vacuum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">3. Given the countless number of things in our world of which it is theoretically possible to be conscious, awareness clearly involves a process of selection. In choosing to attend here, I implicitly choose not to attend elsewhere—at least in this moment. Sitting at my computer and writing this book, I am relatively oblivious to the rest of my environment. If I shift my focus, I become aware of the sound of passing automobiles, the sound of a child shouting and a dog barking. In another instant all that will be lost to conscious awareness and my mind will be absorbed by the words on my computer screen and the words forming in my mind. My purpose and values dictate the standard of selection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I am writing, I am often in a state of such concentration as to be trancelike; a ruthless process of selection is at work, but within that context I would say I am operating at a high level of consciousness. However, if, without changing my state, still preoccupied with my thoughts and oblivious to my external environment, I were to drive my automobile, I could be charged with operating at a dangerously low level <a></a>of consciousness because I had not adapted to the change of context and purpose. To say it once more: Only context can determine what mind-state is appropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Being Responsible Toward Reality</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Living consciously implies respect for the facts of reality. This means the facts of our inner world (needs, wants, emotions) as well as of the outer world. This contrasts with that disrespect for reality contained in an attitude that amounts to, “If I don’t choose to see it or acknowledge it, it doesn’t exist.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">When we live consciously we do not imagine that our feelings are an infallible guide to truth.</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Living consciously is living <em class="calibre23">responsibly toward reality</em>. We do not necessarily have to like what we see, but we recognize that that which is, is, and that which is not, is not. Wishes or fears or denials do not alter facts. If I desire a new outfit but need the money for rent, my desire does not transform reality and make the purchase rational. If I fear an operation my physician assures me is necessary to save my life, my fear does not mean I will live equally well without the operation. If a statement is true, my denying it will not make it false.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, when we live consciously we do not confuse the subjective with the objective. We do not imagine that our feelings are an infallible guide to truth. We can learn from our feelings, to be sure, and they may even point us in the direction of important facts, but this will entail reflection and reality testing, and this entails the participation of reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This understood, let us look more closely at what the practice of living consciously includes.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Specifics of Living Consciously</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Living consciously entails:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      A mind that is active rather than passive.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      An intelligence that takes joy in its own function.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being “in the moment,” without losing the wider context.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Reaching out toward relevant facts rather than withdrawing from them.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being concerned to distinguish among facts, interpretations, and emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Noticing and confronting my impulses to avoid or deny painful or threatening realities.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being concerned to know “where I am” relative to my various (personal and professional) goals and projects, and whether I am succeeding or failing.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being concerned to know if my actions are in alignment with my purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Searching for feedback from the environment so as to adjust or correct my course when necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Persevering in the attempt to understand in spite of difficulties.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being receptive to new knowledge and willing to reexamine old assumptions.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Being willing to see and correct mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Seeking always to expand awareness—<em class="calibre23">a commitment to learning</em>—therefore, a commitment to growth as a way of life.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      A concern to understand the world around me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      A concern to know not only external reality but also internal reality, the reality of my needs, feelings, aspirations, and motives, so that I am not a stranger or a mystery to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      A concern to be aware of the values that move and guide me, as well as their roots, so that I am not ruled by values I have irrationally adopted or uncritically accepted from others.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Let us look at each of these items in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A mind that is active rather than passive</em></strong>. Here we deal with the most <a></a>fundamental act of self-assertion: the choice to think, to seek awareness, understanding, knowledge, clarity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Implicit in this orientation is another self-esteem virtue, that of self-responsibility. Since I am responsible for my own existence and happiness, I choose to be conscious and to be guided by the clearest understanding of which I am capable. I do not indulge in the fantasy that someone else can spare me the necessity of thought or make my decisions for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">An intelligence that takes joy in its own function</em></strong>. The natural inclination of a child is to take pleasure in the use of mind no less than of body. The child’s primary business is learning. It is also the primary entertainment. To retain that orientation into adulthood, so that consciousness is not a burden but a joy, is the mark of a successfully developed human being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, as adults we cannot <em class="calibre23">choose</em> to feel pleasure in the assertion of consciousness if for one reason or another we associate it with fear, pain, or exhausting effort. But anyone who has persevered, overcome such barriers, and learned to live more consciously will say that such learning becomes an increasingly greater source of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being “in the moment,” without losing the wider context</em></strong>. Contained in the idea of living consciously is that of being <em class="calibre23">present</em> to what one is doing. If I am listening to the complaint of a customer, being <em class="calibre23">present</em> to the experience. If I am playing with my child, being <em class="calibre23">present</em> to the activity. If I am working with a psychotherapy client, being with the client and not somewhere else. <em class="calibre23">Doing what I am doing while I am doing it</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This does not mean that my awareness is reduced only to immediate sensory experience, disconnected from the wider context of my knowledge. If I cannot remain related to that wider context, my consciousness is impoverished. I wish to be <em class="calibre23">in</em> the moment but not <em class="calibre23">trapped</em> in the moment. This is the balance that allows me to be in the most resourceful state.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Reaching out toward relevant facts rather than withdrawing from them</em></strong>. What determines “relevance” is my needs, wants, values, goals, and actions. Do I stay alert to and curious about any information that might cause me to modify my course or correct my assumptions, or do I proceed on the premise that there is nothing new for me to learn? Do I continually seek out new data actively that might be helpful, or do I close my eyes to it even when it is presented? We do not have to ask which option is the more empowering.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being concerned to distinguish among facts, interpretations, and emotions</em></strong>. I <em class="calibre23">see</em> you frowning; I <em class="calibre23">interpret</em> this to mean you are angry with <a></a>me; I <em class="calibre23">feel</em> hurt or defensive or wronged. In reality, I may be correct or incorrect in my interpretation. I may be appropriate or inappropriate in the feeling with which I respond. In any event, separate and distinct processes are involved. If I am not conscious of this, I tend to treat my feelings as the voice of reality, which can lead me to disaster.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Fear and pain should be treated as signals not to close our eyes but to open them wider</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Or again, I <em class="calibre23">hear</em> that physicists are struggling with a problem they find insurmountable (let us assume this is so); I <em class="calibre23">interpret</em> this to mean that reason and science have failed; I <em class="calibre23">feel</em> disheartened and disturbed, or elated and triumphant (depending on my other philosophical beliefs). In reality, all that is established is that physicists say they are stuck on a problem. The rest is what my mind makes of it, which may be rational or irrational, but which in either case says more about me than about external reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To live consciously, I need to be sensitive to these distinctions. What I perceive, what I interpret it to mean, and how I feel about it are three separate questions. If I do not distinguish among them, my grounding in reality becomes the first casualty. Which means my efficacy becomes the first casualty.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Noticing and confronting my impulses to avoid or deny painful or threatening realities</em></strong>. Nothing is more natural than to avoid what evokes fear or pain. Since this includes facts our self-interest requires us to face and consider, we may have to override avoidance impulses. But this requires that we be aware of such impulses. What we need then is an orientation of self-examination and self-awareness—of consciousness directed inward as well as outward. Part of living consciously is being on guard against the sometimes seductive pull of unconsciousness; this asks for the most ruthless honesty of which we are capable. Fear and pain should be treated as signals not to close our eyes but to open them wider, not to look away but to look more attentively. This is far from an easy or effortless task. It is unrealistic to imagine that we will always execute it perfectly. But there will be great differences among us with regard to the sincerity of our intention; and degrees matter. Self-esteem asks not for flawless success but for the earnest <em class="calibre23">intention</em> to be conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being concerned to know “where I am” relative to my various (personal <a></a>and professional) goals and projects, and whether I am succeeding or failing</em></strong>. If one of my goals is to have a successful and satisfying marriage, what is the present state of my marriage? Do I know? Would my partner and I answer the same way? Are my partner and I happy with each other? Are there frustrations and unresolved issues? If so, what am I doing about them? Do I have an action plan, or am I merely hoping that “somehow” things will improve? If one of my aspirations is one day to have my own business, what am I doing about it? Am I closer to that goal than I was a month ago or a year ago? Am I on track or off? If one of my ambitions is to be a professional writer, where am I at present relative to the fulfillment of that ambition? What am I doing to actualize it? Will I be closer to fulfillment next year than this year? If so, why? Am I bringing as much consciousness to my projects as I need to?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being concerned to know if my actions are in alignment with my purposes</em></strong>. This issue is closely related to the preceding one. Sometimes there was great lack of congruence between what we say our goals or purposes are and how we invest our time and energy. That which we profess to care about most may get least from us in attention—whereas that which we say matters much less receives far more from us. So living consciously entails monitoring my actions relative to my goals, looking for evidence of alignment or misalignment. If there is misalignment, either my actions or my goals need to be rethought.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Searching for feedback from the environment so as to adjust or correct my course when necessary</em></strong>. When a pilot flies from Los Angeles to New York, he or she is always slightly off course. This information, called feedback, is relayed back via instruments so that continuing adjustments are made to keep the plane on the right path. In the conduct of our life and the pursuit of our goals, we cannot safely set our course once and remain blind thereafter. The potential always exists that new information will require an adjustment of our plans and intentions.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A business leader who operates at a high level of consciousness plans for tomorrow’s market</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we are operating a business, perhaps we need to revise our advertising strategy. Perhaps the, manager we counted on is proving unable to do the job. Perhaps the product that seemed like a brilliant idea when first conceived has been made obsolete by a competitor. Perhaps the sudden <a></a>emergence of new competitors from other countries obliges us to rethink our global strategy. Perhaps recently reported changes in demographics has future implications for our business that we need to be examining now and relating to our present projections. How quick we will be to note such developments and respond appropriately has everything to do with the level of consciousness at which we operate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A business leader who operates at a high level of consciousness plans for tomorrow’s market; a leader operating at a more modest level thinks in terms of today’s; a leader operating at a low level may not realize that he is still thinking in terms of yesterday’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On a more personal level, suppose I would like certain new behaviors from my spouse. I take certain actions aimed at evoking these changes. Do I persist in these actions without noting whether they produce a desired result? Do my spouse and I have the identical conversation forty times? Or, if I see that what I am doing is not working, <em class="calibre23">do I try something else?</em> In other words, do I operate <em class="calibre23">mechanically</em> or <em class="calibre23">consciously?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Persevering in the attempt to understand in spite of difficulties</em></strong>. In my pursuit of understanding and mastery I sometimes encounter difficulties. When this happens, I have a choice: to persevere or give up. Students face this alternative in their school studies. Scientists face it in struggling with research problems. Executives face it in the thousand challenges of everyday business. Everyone faces it in personal relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we persevere in the will to efficacy yet seem stopped by a barrier we cannot move through, we may take a rest or try a new approach, but we do not surrender to despair or resign ourselves to defeat. In contrast, if we give up, withdraw, fall into passivity, or go through the motions of trying without meaning it, we shrink the level of our consciousness—to escape the pain and frustration that accompanied our efforts. The world belongs to those who persevere. I am reminded of a story told about Winston Churchill. He was invited to address a graduating class at a school, and the students waited expectantly through the laudatory introduction he received, eager for what the great man would say. Finally, Churchill stood up, looked down at the class, and thundered, “Never-never-never-never-never-never-never give up!” Then he sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, sometimes we may rationally choose to discontinue our efforts to understand or master something because, in the context of our other values and concerns, a further expenditure of time, energy, and resources is unjustified. But that is a different issue and off our immediate <a></a>point, except to note that the decision to discontinue should be <em class="calibre23">conscious</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being receptive to new knowledge and willing to reexamine old assumptions</em></strong>. We are not operating at a high level of consciousness if we are absorbed totally by what we believe we already know and are uninterested in, or closed to, new information that might bear on our ideas and convictions. Such an attitude excludes the possibility of growth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The alternative is not to hold everything we think in doubt but rather to maintain an openness to new experience and knowledge—because even when we are not mistaken to begin with, even when our starting premises are valid, new clarifications, amendments, and improvements in our understanding are always possible. And sometimes our premises <em class="calibre23">are</em> mistaken and need to be revised. Which leads to the next point.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Being willing to see and correct mistakes</em></strong>. When we accept certain ideas or premises as true, it is almost inevitable that over time we become attached to them. The danger then becomes that we may not wish to recognize evidence that we are mistaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said of Charles Darwin that any time he encountered some fact that seemed to militate against his theory of evolution, he wrote it down immediately because he did not trust his memory to retain it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Living consciously implies that my first loyalty is to truth, not to making myself right. All of us are wrong some of the time, all of us make mistakes, but if we have tied our self-esteem (or our pseudo self-esteem) to being above error, or if we have become overattached to our own positions, we are obliged to shrink consciousness in misguided self-protection. To find it humiliating to admit an error is a certain sign of flawed self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Seeking always to expand awareness—a commitment to learning—therefore, a commitment to growth as a way of life</em></strong>. In the second half of the nineteenth century the head of the U.S. Patent Office announced, “Everything of importance that can be invented has been invented.” This was the prevailing viewpoint throughout almost all human history. Until very recently, for the hundreds of thousands of years that Homo sapiens has existed on this planet, people saw existence as essentially unchanging. They believed that the knowledge possible to humans was already known. The idea of human life as a process of advancing from knowledge to new knowledge, from discovery to discovery—let alone of one scientific and technological breakthrough following another with exhilarating and disorienting speed—is only a <a></a>couple of seconds old, measured in evolutionary time. In contrast to all the centuries behind us, we are living in an age when the total of human knowledge <em class="calibre23">doubles about every ten years</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a commitment to lifelong learning can allow us to remain adaptive to our world. Those who believe they have “thought enough” and “learned enough” are on a downward trajectory of increasing unconsciousness. The resistance of many people to becoming computer literate is a simple example. I recall a vice-president in a brokerage firm saying to me, “Having to struggle with learning a computer was devastating to my self-esteem. I didn’t <em class="calibre23">want</em> to learn. Yet I had no choice—it was necessary. But what a battle!”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">To find it humiliating to admit an error is a certain sign of flawed self-esteem</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A concern to understand the world around me</em></strong>. All of us are affected, in more ways than we can know, perhaps, by the world in which we live—physically, culturally, socially, economically, politically. The physical environment has consequences for our health. The cultural environment affects our attitudes, values, and the pleasure we take (or don’t take) in what we see, hear, and read. The social environment may have an impact on the serenity or turbulence of our existence. Economic factors affect our standard of living. Political factors affect the measure of our freedom and the extent of our control over our lives. Some would add to this list of the significant constituents of our context the cosmic or religious or spiritual dimension, however one interprets those words. In any event, this list is clearly an oversimplification and is offered only to point in a direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be oblivious to such forces, to imagine that we operate in a vacuum, is truly to live as a sleepwalker. Living consciously entails a desire to understand our full context.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Obviously a person of high intelligence with a philosophical disposition may carry this concern farther than a person of more limited intellect. But even among persons of modest powers we can discern differences in interest level with regard to these matters—differences in curiosity, thoughtfulness, awareness that there is something about which to think. And again, since we are neither omniscient nor infallible, it is our intention and its expression in action that is of primary importance.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A concern to know not only external reality but also internal reality, the reality of my needs, feelings, aspirations, and motives, so that I am not a stranger or a mystery to myself</em></strong>. In the course of my work as a psychotherapist I have met many people who are proud of their knowledge of the universe, from physics to political philosophy to aesthetics to the most recent information about Saturn to the teachings of Zen Buddhism—and yet who are blind to the operations of the private universe within. The wreckage of their personal life is a monument to the magnitude of their unconsciousness concerning the internal world of the self. They deny and disown their needs, rationalize their emotions, intellectualize (or “spiritualize”) their behavior—while moving from one unsatisfactory relationship to another or remaining for a lifetime in the same one without doing anything practical to improve it. I am not living consciously if my consciousness is used for everything but self-understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes our efforts at self-examination hit an impasse for which we require the assistance of a guide, teacher, or psychotherapist. My focus here, again, is on an underlying intention, an orientation: a concern to know the inner world of needs, feelings, motives, mental processes. As contrasted with what? That condition of self-estrangement and self-alienation that to varying degrees is the state of most people (and about which I wrote in <em class="calibre23">The Disowned Self</em>).</p>
<p class="calibre2">This intention or concern shows up in such simple questions as: Do I know what I am feeling at any particular moment? Do I recognize the impulses from which my actions spring? Do I notice if my feelings and actions are congruent? Do I know what needs or desires I may be trying to satisfy? Do I know what I actually want in a particular encounter with another person (not what I think I “should” want)? Do I know what my life is about? Is the “program” I am living one I accepted uncritically from others, or is it genuinely of my own choosing? Do I know what I am doing when I particularly like myself and what I am doing when I don’t? These are the kind of questions that intelligent self-examination entails.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Do I know what I am doing when I particularly like myself and what I am doing when I don’t?</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Note that this is entirely different from a morbid self-absorption that consists of taking one’s emotional temperature every ten minutes. I am not recommending obsessive self-preoccupation. I do not even like to <a></a>talk about “introspection” in this context because it suggests something far more technical and remote from the average person’s experience. I prefer to talk about “the art of noticing.” Noticing the feelings in my body. Noticing my emotions during an encounter with someone. Noticing patterns in my behavior that may not be serving me. Noticing what excites me and what drains me. Noticing whether the voice inside my head is truly my own or belongs to someone else—perhaps my mother. To notice, I have to be interested. I have to think the practice worthwhile. I have to believe there is value in knowing myself. I may have to be willing to look at troublesome facts. I have to be convinced that, longterm, I have more to gain from consciousness than unconsciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why do we need to notice bodily feelings? Well, to offer only one of many possibilities, this would be very useful to a driven individual who would prefer to avoid a heart attack and who would thus benefit from advance warnings of stress. Why do we need to notice our emotions during an encounter with someone? To better understand our actions and reactions. Why do we need to notice our patterns of behavior? To know which actions are producing desired results and which aren’t, and to discover what patterns need to be challenged. Why do we need to notice what is exciting and what is draining? To do more of the first and less of the second (a correction that by no means happens automatically or “instinctively”). Why might it be worth our efforts to identify the different voices speaking within? To recognize alien influences with alien agendas (the voice of a parent or a religious authority, for example), to learn how to distinguish one’s own true voice from all others, to operate one’s life as an autonomous human being.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">A concern to be aware of the values that move and guide me, as well as their roots, so that I am not ruled by values I have irrationally adopted or uncritically accepted from others</em>.</strong> This point is closely related to the foregoing. One of the forms that living unconsciously takes is obliviousness to the values guiding one’s actions and even indifference to the question. All of us sometimes draw mistaken or irrational conclusions from our experience on the basis of which we may form values harmful to our well-being. All of us absorb values from the world around us—from family, peers, and culture—and these values are not necessarily rational or supportive of our true interests; often, in fact, they are not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A young person may see many examples of dishonesty and hypocrisy while growing up, may conclude, in effect, “This is the way the world works, and I must adapt to it,” and may as a consequence disvalue honesty and integrity.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">A man may be socialized to identify personal worth with income; a woman may be socialized to identify personal worth with the status of the man she marries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such values subvert healthy self-esteem, and almost inevitably lead to self-alienation and to tragic life decisions. Living consciously, therefore, entails reflecting on and weighing in the light of reason and personal experience the values that set our goals and purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Note on Addictions</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The avoidance of consciousness is clearly evident in problems of addiction. When we become addicted to alcohol or drugs or destructive relationships, the implicit intention is invariably to ameliorate anxiety and pain—to escape awareness of one’s core feelings of powerlessness and suffering. What we become addicted to are tranquilizers and anodynes. Anxiety and pain are not extinguished, they are merely rendered less conscious. Since they inevitably resurface with still greater intensity, larger and larger doses of poison are needed to keep consciousness at bay.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Self-destruction is an act best performed in the dark</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When we become addicted to stimulants, we are avoiding the exhaustion or depression they are intended to mask. Whatever else may be involved in a particular case, what is always involved is the avoidance of consciousness. Sometimes what is avoided are the implications of a lifestyle that requires stimulants to be sustained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the addict, consciousness is the enemy. If I have reason to know that alcohol is dangerous to me and I nonetheless take a drink, I must first turn down the light of awareness. If I know that cocaine has cost me my last three jobs and I nonetheless choose to take a snort, I must first blank out my knowledge, must refuse to see what I see and know what I know. If I recognize that I am in a relationship that is destructive to my dignity, ruinous for my self-esteem, and dangerous to my physical well-being, and if I nonetheless choose to remain in it, I must first drown out the voice of reason, fog my brain, and make myself functionally stupid. Self-destruction is an act best performed in the dark.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Personal Example</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">All of us can look back over our life and think of times when we did not bring to some concern as much consciousness as was needed. We tell ourselves, “If only I had thought more!” “If only I hadn’t been so impulsive!” “If only I had checked the facts more carefully!” “If only I had looked ahead a bit!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think of my first marriage, when I was twenty-two years old. I think of all the signs (apart from our youth) that we were making a mistake: the numerous conflicts between us, the incompatibilities in some of our values, the ways in which at the core we were not each other’s “type.” Why, then, did I proceed? Because of our shared commitment to certain ideas and ideals. Because of sexual attraction. Because I desperately wanted to have a woman in my life. Because she was the first person from whom I did not feel alienated—and I lacked the confidence that another would come along. Because I naively imagined that marriage could solve all the problems between us. There were “reasons,” to be sure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, if someone had said to me (or if I had somehow thought to say to myself), “If you were to bring a higher level of consciousness to your relationship with Barbara, and to do so steadily, day after day, what do you suppose might happen?” I have to wonder what I might have been led to face and come to grips with. To a mind that is receptive, so simple yet provocative a question can have astonishing potency.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fact was, I examined neither the feelings driving me toward marriage nor the feelings signaling danger. I did not confront the logical and obvious questions: Why marry <em class="calibre23">now?</em> Why not wait until more is resolved between you? And because of what I did not do, my self-esteem suffered a subtle wound—some part of me knew I was avoiding awareness—although it would be years before I fully understood this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is an exercise that I give to therapy clients today that I wish I had known about then. The course of my life over the next decade or so might have been different. I will discuss this exercise and others like it below, but for the moment let me say this. If for two weeks I had sat at my desk each morning and wrote the following incomplete sentence in my notebook: “If I bring a higher level of consciousness to my relationship with Barbara—” and then wrote six to ten endings as rapidly as I could, without rehearsing, censoring, planning, or “thinking,” I would have found myself making more and more conscious, explicit, and inescapable <a></a>all the deep reservations I had about this relationship as well as my process of avoidance and denial.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have given this exercise to clients who are confused or conflicted about some relationship, and the result almost invariably is major clarification. Sometimes the relationship radically improves; sometimes it ends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Had I known to use this technique, I would have had to face the fact that loneliness was driving me more than admiration. If Barbara had done a similar exercise, she would have realized that she was no more rational than I in what we were preparing to do. Whether we would have had the courage and wisdom to stay at this higher level of awareness is something I can only speculate about now. That one wakes up for a time is no guarantee that one will remain awake. Still, judging from the experience of my clients, it would have been extraordinarily difficult for us to persist blindly on our course because we would no longer have been blind, and opening one door clears the way to opening another and then another.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Consciousness and the Body</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">It was the achievement of Wilhelm Reich to bring the body into psychotherapy—in other words, to make clinicians aware that when feelings and emotions are blocked and repressed, the process of implementation is physical: Breathing is restricted and muscles are contracted. When this happens repeatedly, the blocks become part of the body structure—“the body armor,” in Reich’s phrase—and what began as the psychological becomes somaticized. Breathing may be so habitually shallow and muscles so little contracted that the flow of feeling is obstructed and consciousness is diminished accordingly. When body therapists work to release the breathing and open areas of tight muscular contraction, the person <em class="calibre23">feels</em> more <em class="calibre23">and is more aware</em>. Body work can liberate blocked consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is true in all the schools of body work that have gone beyond Reich to a more advanced understanding of the interactions between psyche and soma. Freeing the body contributes to freeing the mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the early 1970s I went through a program of “rolfing” (named after founder Ida Rolf), more formally called “structural integration.” This process involves deep massage and manipulation of the muscle fascia to realign the body in more appropriate relation to gravity, to correct imbalances <a></a>caused by entrenched muscular contractions, and to open areas of blocked feeling and energy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was fascinated by the response of my clients. Many said they saw changes, week by week: I became more sensitive and more perceptive in my work. As my own body seemed to open to me and somehow to become more “available,” I found that I could more expertly “read” the bodies of others. I saw how a client was sitting, standing, or moving, and I instantly knew volumes about his or her inner life. Spontaneously I had shifted to a much higher level of consciousness in my work through a process that began as increased consciousness of my own body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I reported this enthusiastically to the man who was rolfing me, he said that not everyone had that experience and that it was the result not of the rolfing alone but also of the high level of awareness with which I participated in the process. “It’s like psychotherapy,” he explained. “Clients who bring a lot of consciousness to the work do better than clients who are more passive, who just show up and expect the therapist to do everything.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The point I am making is that if one’s goal is to operate at a high level of consciousness, a body armored against feeling is a serious impediment.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Sentence Completions to Facilitate the Art of Living Consciously</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Sentence-completion work is a deceptively simple yet uniquely powerful tool for raising self-understanding, self-esteem, and personal effectiveness. It rests on the premise that all of us have more knowledge than we normally are aware of—more wisdom than we use, more potentials than typically show up in our behavior. Sentence completion is a tool for accessing and activating these “hidden resources.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sentence completion can be used in many ways. Here I will describe a way I find particularly effective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The essence of this procedure is to write an incomplete sentence, a sentence stem, and to keep adding different endings—the sole requirement being that each ending be a grammatical completion of the sentence. We want a minimum of six endings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We should work as rapidly as possible—no pauses to “think,” inventing if we get stuck, without worrying if any particular ending is true, reasonable, or significant. <em class="calibre23">Any</em> ending is fine, <em class="calibre23">just keep going</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When doing sentence completion this way, we work with a notebook, <a></a>typewriter, or computer. (An acceptable alternative is to do the sentence completions into a tape recorder, in which case you keep repeating the stem into a recorder, each time completing it with a difference ending. You play the work back later to reflect on it.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sentence-completion work can be used for many different purposes. Some of them will be examined in the course of this book. Right now, how might we use the technique to facilitate the process of learning to live more consciously?</p>
<p class="calibre2">First thing in the morning, before proceeding to the day’s business, sit down and write the following stem:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">Living consciously to me means</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre36">Then, as rapidly as possible, without pausing for reflection, write as many endings for that sentence as you can in two or three minutes (never fewer than six, but ten is enough). Do not worry if your endings are literally true, make sense, or are “profound.” Write <em class="calibre23">anything</em>, but write <em class="calibre23">something</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, go on to the next stem:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my activities today</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre36">(Why only 5 percent? Let us proceed in small, nonintimidating, “bite-size chews.” Besides, most of the time 5 percent is plenty!)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I pay more attention to how I deal with people today—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">Then:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my most important relationships—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">Then:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to (fill in a particular problem you are concerned about—for example, your relationship with someone, or a barrier you’ve hit at work, or your feelings of anxiety or depression)—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">When you are finished, proceed with your day’s business.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the end of the day, as your last task before dinner, do six to ten endings each for the following stems:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">When I reflect on how I would feel if I lived more consciously—</strong></p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre43">           <strong class="calibre6">When I reflect what happens when I bring 5 percent more awareness to my activities—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">           <strong class="calibre6">When I reflect on what happens when I bring 5 percent more awareness to my most important relationships—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">           <strong class="calibre6">When I reflect on what happens when I bring 5 percent more awareness to (whatever you’ve filled in)</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre36">Do this exercise every day, Monday through Friday for the first week.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do not read what you wrote the day before. Naturally there will be many repetitions. But also, new endings will inevitably occur. You are energizing all of your psyche to work for you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometime each weekend, reread what you have written for the week, and then write a minimum of six endings for this stem:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">If any of what I wrote this week is true, it would be helpful if I—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">In doing this work, the ideal is to empty your mind of any expectations concerning what will happen or what is “supposed” to happen. Do not impose any demands on the situation. Try to empty your mind of expectations. Do the exercise, go about your day’s activities, and merely notice any differences in how you feel or how you operate. You will discover that you have set in motion forces that make it virtually impossible for you to avoid operating more consciously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An average session should not take longer than ten minutes. If it takes much longer, you are “thinking” (rehearsing, calculating) too much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Notice that the second set of stems of the day relate to the morning’s work. I call this the “bookend” approach to sentence completion. The knowledge that those stems are waiting to be completed later in the day energizes the motivation to be more conscious throughout the day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The technique can be thought of as a procedure for learning to manage our attention—more broadly, to manage the mind’s “spontaneous” activities. There is a discipline to maintaining good self-esteem. And the foundation is the discipline of consciousness itself. This is what the technique aims to assist and support.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After you have worked with the above stems for, say, two weeks, you acquire a sense of how the procedure works. Then you can begin to use other stems to help raise your awareness with regard to particular issues of concern. For example:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to when I am mentally active and when I am mentally passive, I might see that—</strong></p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre43">      (Evening stem: <strong class="calibre6">When I notice what happens when I… etc.)</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my relationship with (fill in a name)—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my insecurities—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my depression—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my concern about (fill it in)—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my impulses to avoid unpleasant facts—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my needs and wants—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my deepest values and goals—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my emotions—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my priorities—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to how I sometimes stand in my own way—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to the outcomes of my actions—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to how I sometimes make it difficult for people to give me what I want—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">A few career-oriented stems:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to what my job requires of me—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to what I know about being an effective manager—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to what I know about making sales—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to what I know about appropriate delegating—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre36">A few stems to explore “resistance”:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I imagine bringing more consciousness into my life—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">The scary thing about being more conscious might be—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I bring 5 percent more awareness to my fear of operating more consciously</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre36">I trust this is sufficient to make clear that the possibilities are almost inexhaustible. In each of the above examples, the corresponding evening stem is obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition to my psychotherapy practice, I conduct weekly ongoing self-esteem groups where many of my self-esteem-building strategies are continually tested. Homework assignments using exercises such as the above have proven to be powerful in quietly and gently generating <a></a>change. No one has ever done this particular “consciousness exercise” for a month or two without reporting (and showing signs of) operating at a higher level of awareness in the conduct of daily life. The exercise is adrenaline shot into the psyche.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Challenge</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Living consciously is both a practice and a mind-set, an orientation toward life. Clearly it exists on a continuum. No one lives entirely unconsciously. No one is incapable of expanding his or her consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we reflect on this issue, we will notice that we tend to be more conscious in some areas of our life than in others. I have worked with athletes and dancers who are exquisitely aware of the slightest nuances within their body, as far as nerves, muscles, and blood flow are concerned—and yet who are quite unaware of the meaning of many of their emotions. We all know people who are brilliantly conscious in the area of work and are catastrophes of unconsciousness in their personal relationships.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We tend to be more conscious in some areas of our life than in others.</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The ways we know what area of our life needs more awareness are usually fairly obvious. We look at the area where our life is working least satisfactorily. We notice where the pains and frustrations are. We observe where we feel least effective. If we are willing to be honest, this is not a difficult task. Some of us may need to bring more awareness to the territory of our basic material needs. Others need more focus on relationships. Others need more focus on intellectual development. Others need to examine unexplored possibilities of creativity and achievement. Others need more concern with spiritual growth. Which need requires priority is a function of where we are in our overall evolution, and also of our objective circumstances. Context determines appropriateness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let us suppose that, meditating on the material in this chapter, you identify the areas in your life where you are at your most conscious and also the areas where you are at your least conscious. The next step is to reflect on what seems to be difficult about staying in high-level mental <a></a>focus in the troublesome areas. Sentence-completion work can help. For example:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">The hard thing about staying fully conscious here is—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre14">Write six to ten endings as quickly as you can. Then try:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">The good thing about not being fully conscious here is—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre14">Then try:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I were to stay more conscious here—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre14">Then:</p>
<p class="calibre43">      <strong class="calibre6">If I were to experiment with raising my consciousness 5 percent in this area—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre14">(Remember the principle of “bite-size chews.”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right now, before checking what sentence-completion work can accomplish, you might find it stimulating to consider the following questions:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      If you choose to be more conscious at work, what might you do differently?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If you choose to be more conscious in your most important relationships, what might you do differently?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If you choose to pay more attention to how you deal with people—associates, employees, customers, spouse, children, or friends—what might you do differently?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If you feel fear or reluctance to expand consciousness in any of these areas, what are the imagined negatives you are avoiding?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If, without self-reproach, you bring more consciousness to your fears or reluctance, what might you notice?</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If you wanted to feel more powerful and effective in the areas where your consciousness has been less than it needs to be, <em class="calibre23">what are you willing to do?</em></p>
