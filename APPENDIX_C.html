<p class="calibre22">The central focus of my work has been the study of self-esteem, its role in human life, and, most particularly, its impact on work and love. If you have found the work you have just read of value, then the following works are suggested for further reading.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">The Psychology of Self-Esteem</em>. This is my first major theoretical exploration and overview of the entire field. Unlike my later books, it puts heavy emphasis on the philosophical foundations of my work. It deals with such questions as: What is the meaning—and justification—of the idea of free will? What is the relation of reason and emotion? How do rationality and integrity relate to self-esteem? Which moral values support self-esteem and which undermine it? Why is self-esteem the key to motivation?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Breaking Free</em>. This is an exploration of the childhood origins of negative self-concepts, dramatized through a series of vignettes taken from my clinical practice. Through these stories we see in what ways adults can adversely affect the development of a child’s self-esteem. Indirectly, therefore, the book is a primer on the art of child-rearing.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">The Disowned Self</em>. This book examines the painful and widespread problem of self-alienation, in which the individual is out of touch with his or her inner world, and indicates pathways to recovery. This book has proven especially helpful for adult children of dysfunctional families. It takes a fresh look at the relation of reason and emotion that goes beyond my earlier treatment of the subject in its scope and depth. Demonstrating <a></a>how and why self-acceptance is essential to healthy self-esteem, it points the way to the harmonious integration of thought and feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">The Psychology of Romantic Love</em>. In this book I explore the nature and meaning of romantic love, its difference from other kinds of love, its historical development, and its special challenges in the modern world. It addresses such questions as: What is love? Why is love born? Why does it sometimes flourish? Why does it sometimes die?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">What Love Asks of Us</em>. Originally published as <em class="calibre23">The Romantic Love Question-and-Answer Book</em>, this revised and expanded edition, written with my wife and colleague, Devers Branden, addresses the questions we hear most often from those struggling with the practical challenges of making love work. It covers a wide range of topics, from the importance of autonomy in relationships, to the art of effective communication, to conflict-resolution skills, to dealing with jealousy and infidelity, to coping with the special challenges of children and in-laws, to surviving the loss of love.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Honoring the Self</em>. Again returning to the nature of self-esteem and its role in our existence, this book is less philosophical than <em class="calibre23">The Psychology of Self-Esteem</em> and more developmental in its focus. It looks at how the self emerges, evolves, and moves through progressively higher stages of individuation. It explores what adults can do to raise the level of their own self-esteem. It examines the psychology of guilt. It addresses the relationship between self-esteem and productive work. It upholds a morality of enlightened self-interest and challenges the traditional notion that self-sacrifice is the essence of virtue.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">If You Could Hear What I Cannot Say</em>. This is a workbook. It teaches the fundamentals of my sentence-completion technique and how it can be used by a person working alone for self-exploration, self-understanding, self-healing, and personal growth.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">The Art of Self-Discovery</em>. This book carries further the work of the preceding volume on sentence completion and self-exploration. Originally published as <em class="calibre23">To See What I See and Know What I Know</em>, this revised and expanded edition also provides counselors and psychotherapists with tools to be utilized in their own clinical practice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">How to Raise Your Self-Esteem</em>. The purpose here is to provide the reader with specific strategies for building self-esteem. The discussion is more concrete than in my earlier writings, more action oriented. It is addressed equally to people working on their own development and to parents, teachers, and psychotherapists who are invited to experiment with the techniques.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand</em>. This investigative memoir tells the story of my personal and intellectual development, including the rises and falls and rises of my own self-esteem, through my relationship with three women, of which the centerpiece is my relationship with novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand (<em class="calibre23">The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged</em>). It describes the extraordinary contexts in which I came upon some of my most important psychological ideas, including my first understanding, at the age of twenty-four, of the supreme importance of self-esteem to human well-being.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre23">The Power of Self-Esteem</em>. A brief distillation of my key ideas in this field, this book is intended as a basic introduction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through the Branden Institute for Self-Esteem in Los Angeles, we offer psychotherapy and family counseling; conduct ongoing self-esteem groups; give lectures, seminars and workshops; do management consulting; create self-esteem/high-performance programs for organizations; and offer telephone counseling with individual and corporate clients.</p>
