<p class="calibre22">The proper aim of parental nurturing is to prepare a child for independent survival as an adult. An infant begins in a condition of total dependency. If his or her upbringing is successful, the young man or woman will have evolved out of that dependency into a self-respecting and self-responsible human being who is able to respond to the challenges of life competently and enthusiastically. He or she will be “self-supporting”—not merely financially, but intellectually and psychologically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A newborn infant does not yet have a sense of personal identity; there is no awareness of separateness, not, at any rate, as we who are adults experience such awareness. To evolve into selfhood is the primary human task. It is also the primary human challenge, because success is not guaranteed. At any step of the way, the process can be interrupted, frustrated, blocked, or sidetracked, so that the human individual is fragmented, split, alienated, stuck at one level or another of mental or emotional maturity. It is not difficult to observe that most people are stranded somewhere along this path of development. Nonetheless, as I discuss in <em class="calibre23">Honoring the Self</em>, the central goal of the maturational process is <em class="calibre23">evolution toward autonomy</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is an old and excellent adage that effective parenting consists first of giving a child roots (to grow) and then wings (to fly). The security of a firm base—and the self-confidence one day to leave it. Children do not grow up in a vacuum. They grow up in a social context. Indeed, much of <a></a>the drama of unfolding individuation and autonomy occurs and can only occur in and through encounters with other human beings. In the first encounters of childhood, a child can experience the safety and security that allows a self to emerge—or the terror and instability that fractures the self before it is fully formed. In subsequent encounters, a child can experience being accepted and respected or rejected and demeaned. A child can experience the appropriate balance of protection and freedom or (1) the overprotectiveness that infantilizes or (2) the underprotectiveness that demands of the child resources that may not yet exist. Such experiences, as well as others we will discuss, contribute to the kind of self and self-esteem that develops over time.</p>

<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Antecedents of Self-Esteem</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Some of the best work that psychologists have done concerning self-esteem has been in the area of child-parent relations. An example is Stanley Coopersmith’s landmark study, <em class="calibre23">The Antecedents of Self-Esteem</em>. Coopersmith’s goal was to identify the parental behaviors most often found where children grew up manifesting healthy self-esteem. I want to distill the essence of his report, as a prologue to the discussion that follows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Coopersmith discovered no significant correlations with such factors as family wealth, education, geographic living area, social class, Father’s occupation, or always having Mother at home. What he did find to be significant was the quality of the relationship between the child and the important adults in his or her life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Specifically, he found five conditions associated with high self-esteem in children:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">1</strong>. The child experiences total acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and the value of his or her person.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">2</strong>. The child operates in a context of clearly defined and enforced limits that are fair, nonoppressive, and negotiable. The child is not given unrestricted “freedom.” Consequently, the child experiences a sense of <a></a>security; there is a clear basis for evaluating his or her behavior. Further, the limits generally entail high standards, as well as confidence that the child will be able to meet them. Consequently, the child usually does.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">3</strong>. The child experiences respect for his or her dignity as a human being. The parents do not use violence or humiliation or ridicule to control and manipulate. The parents take the child’s needs and wishes seriously, whether or not they can accede to them in a particular instance. The parents are willing to negotiate family rules within carefully drawn limits. In other words, authority, but not authoritarianism, is operating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an expression of this overall attitude, parents are less inclined to punitive discipline (and there tends to be less need for punitive discipline), and more inclined to put the emphasis on rewarding and reinforcing positive behavior. They focus on what they do want rather than on what they do not want—on the positive rather than the negative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The parents show an interest in the child, in his or her social and academic life, and they are generally available for discussion when and as the child wants it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">4</strong>. The parents uphold high standards and high expectations in terms of behavior and performance. Their attitude is not “anything goes.” They have both moral and performance expectations that they convey in a respectful, benevolent, and nonoppressive manner; the child is challenged to be the best he or she can be.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">5</strong>. The parents themselves tend to enjoy a high level of self-esteem. They model (what I call) self-efficacy and self-respect. The child sees living examples of that which he or she needs to learn. After carefully explaining such antecedents of self-esteem as his research could reveal, Coopersmith goes on to observe: “We should note that there are virtually no parental patterns of behavior or parental attitudes that are common to all parents of children with high self-esteem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">This last observation underscores our awareness that parental behavior alone does not decide the course of a child’s psychological development. Apart from the fact that sometimes the most important influence in a child’s life is a teacher, or a grandparent, or a neighbor, external factors are only part of the story, never the whole, as I have stressed repeatedly. We are causes, not merely effects. As beings whose consciousness is volitional, beginning in childhood and continuing throughout our life we make choices that have consequences for the kind of person we become and the level of self-esteem we attain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To say that parents can make it easier or harder for a child to develop <a></a>healthy self-esteem is to say that parents can make it easier or harder for a young person to learn the six practices and make them a natural and integral part of his or her life. The six practices provide a standard for assessing parental policies: Do these policies encourage or discourage consciousness, self-acceptance, self-responsibility, self-assertiveness, purposefulness, and integrity? Do they raise or lower the probability that a child will learn self-esteem-supporting behaviors?</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Basic Safety and Security</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Beginning life in a condition of total dependency, a child has no more basic requirement—as far as parental behavior is concerned—than that of safety and security. This entails the satisfaction of physiological needs, protection from the elements, and basic caretaking in all its obvious aspects. It entails the creation of an environment in which the child can feel nurtured and safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this context the process of separation and individuation can unfold. A mind that can later learn to trust itself can begin to emerge. A person with a confident sense of boundaries can develop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the child is to learn to trust other human beings, and, in effect, to find confidence that life is not malevolent, the foundation is laid at this level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the need for safety and security is not limited to the early years. The self is still forming during adolescence, and a home life of chaos and anxiety can place severe obstacles in the path of normal teenage development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my work with adults I often see the long-term effects of one form of trauma associated with the frustration of this need—a child’s repeated experience of terror at the hands of adults. Certain therapy clients convey a quality of fear or anxiety that seems to reach back to the first months of life and to invade the deepest structure of the psyche. Such clients are distinguished not only by the intensity of their anxiety, nor by its pervasiveness, but by the fact that one senses that the person experiencing the anxiety is not the adult but rather a child or even an infant inside that adult’s body—or, more precisely, inside the adult’s psyche. These clients report that they have had feelings of basic terror as far back as they can remember.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Setting aside the possibility of birth trauma, there are two factors to be considered here. The first is the objective circumstances of their environment <a></a>and the treatment they received as children. The second is the question of an innate disposition to experience anxiety: some individuals’ threshold is almost certainly lower than others, so that what is not traumatic for one child is for another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The terror might be of a physically violent father, a moody, unpredictable, emotionally disturbed mother, a menacing family member whose scowl conjures up images of unimaginable torture—a terror from which there is no escape and that plunges the child into unbearable feelings of helplessness.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">The greater a child’s terror, and the earlier it is experienced, the harder the task of building a strong and healthy sense of self</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      A nurse of thirty-eight, Sonia would involuntarily flinch if I inadvertently raised my voice slightly, especially while shifting in my chair. She claimed that her earliest memories were of her mother and father screaming at each other while she lay in her crib with her own cries ignored. Her sense that the world is a hostile and dangerous place was almost cellular. She was motivated by fear in almost all of her choices and actions, with negative consequences for her self-esteem. I suspected that she came into this world with a greater-than-average disposition to experience anxiety, made immeasurably worse by two parents under the sway of the irrational within themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      A thirty-four-year-old professor of philosophy, Edgar said his earliest memories were of being forced to stand on the bed while his father—a distinguished and respected physician in his community—beat him violently with a strap. “My cries could never make him stop. It was as if he were insane. He could destroy me and there was nothing I could do. That feeling has never left me. I’m thirty-four years old and I still feel that in the face of any kind of danger I have no means of defending myself. I’m afraid. I’ve always been afraid. I can’t imagine who I would be without my fear.”</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The greater a child’s terror, and the earlier it is experienced, the harder the task of building a strong and healthy sense of self. To learn the six practices on the foundation of an all-consuming sense <a></a>of powerlessness—<strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">traumatic</em></strong> powerlessness—is very difficult. It is against this destructive feeling that good parenting aims to protect a child.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Nurturing Through Touch</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Today we know that touch is essential for a child’s healthy development. In its absence, children can die, even when other needs are met.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through touch we send sensory stimulation that helps the infant’s brain to develop. Through touch we convey love, caring, comfort, support, nurturing. Through touch we establish contact between one human being and another. Research shows that touch—such as massage—can profoundly affect health. At some level this is often known intuitively because in non-Western parts of the world the massaging of babies is standard practice. In the West it is not, and one reason that has been suggested is the bias against the body found in Christianity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the most powerful ways parents can convey love is through touch. Long before a child can understand words, he or she understands touch. Declarations of love without touch are unconvincing and hollow. Our bodies cry out for the reality of the physical. We want to experience that our <em class="calibre23">person</em> is loved—valued—embraced—not some disembodied abstraction.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Long before a child can understand words, he or she understands touch</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Children who grow up with little experience of being touched often carry an ache deep within them that never entirely vanishes. There is a hole in their self-regard. “Why could I never sit on my father’s knee?” clients will say. “Why did Mother convey such reticence—even disgust—about physical touch?” The unspoken sentence is, “Why did they not love me enough to want to hold me?” And sometimes, “If my own parents didn’t want to touch me, how can I expect anyone else to want to?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The pain of this childhood deprivation is difficult to bear. Usually it is repressed. Consciousness contracts and psychic numbing is evoked—as <a></a>a survival strategy, to make existence tolerable. Self-awareness is avoided. This is often the start of a pattern that lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Depending on other psychological factors, we can see two different responses to touch deprivation later in life. On one level they appear opposite, yet both express alienation and both are harmful to self-esteem. On the one hand we may see in an adult an avoidance of intimate contact with other human beings, a withdrawal from human encounters, expressing feelings of fear and unworthiness; a failure of self-assertiveness, among other things. Or we may see compulsive sexual promiscuity, an unconscious effort to heal the wound of touch starvation, but in a way that humiliates without resolving, and personal integrity and self-respect are two of the casualties. Both responses leave the individual isolated from authentic human contact.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Love</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A child who is treated with love tends to internalize the feeling and to experience him- or herself as lovable. Love is conveyed by verbal expression, nurturing actions, and the joy and pleasure we show in the sheer fact of the child’s being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An effective parent can convey anger or disappointment without signaling withdrawal of love. An effective parent can teach without resorting to rejection. The value of the child as a human being is not on trial.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Love is not felt to be real when it is always tied to performance, tied to living up to Mother’s or Father’s expectations, and is withdrawn from time to time as a means of manipulating obedience and conformity. Love is not felt to be real when the child receives subtle or unsubtle messages to the effect, “You are not enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, many of us received such messages. You may have potential, but you are unacceptable as you are. You need to be fixed. One day you may be enough, but not now. You will be enough only if you fulfill our expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am enough” does not mean “I have nothing to learn and nowhere to grow to.” It means “I accept myself as a value as I am.” We cannot build self-esteem on a foundation of “I am not enough.” To convey to a child “You are not enough” is to subvert self-esteem at the core. No child feels loved who receives such messages.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Acceptance</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A child whose thoughts and feelings are treated with acceptance tends to internalize the response and to learn self-acceptance. Acceptance is conveyed, not by agreement (which is not always possible) but by listening to and acknowledging the child’s thoughts and feelings, and by not chastising, arguing, lecturing, psychologizing, or insulting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a child is repeatedly told that he or she must not feel this, must not feel that, the child is encouraged to deny and disown feelings or emotions in order to please or placate parents. If normal expressions of excitement, anger, happiness, sexuality, longing, and fear are treated as unacceptable or wrong or sinful or otherwise distasteful to parents, the child may disown and reject more and more of the self to belong, to be loved, to avoid the terror of abandonment. We do not serve a child’s development by making self-repudiation the price of our love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Few attitudes of parents can be so helpful for the child’s healthy development as the child’s experience that his or her nature, temperament, interests, and aspirations are accepted—<em class="calibre23">whether or not parents share them</em>. It is unrealistic in the extreme to imagine that parents will enjoy or be comfortable with a child’s every act of self-expression. But acceptance in the sense described in this book does not require enjoyment or comfort—or agreement.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">We do not serve a child’s development by making self-repudiation the price of our love</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A parent may be athletic, a child may not be—or the reverse. A parent may be artistic, a child may not be—or the reverse. A parent’s natural rhythms may be fast, a child’s may be slow—or the reverse. A parent may be orderly, a child may be chaotic—or the reverse. A parent may be extroverted, a child may be introverted—or the reverse. A parent may be very “social,” a child may be less so—or the reverse. A parent may be competitive, a child may not be—or the reverse. <em class="calibre23">If differences are accepted, self-esteem can grow</em>.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Respect</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">A child who receives respect from adults tends to learn self-respect. Respect is conveyed by addressing a child with the courtesy one normally extends to adults. (As child psychologist Haim Ginott used to observe, if a visiting guest accidentally spills a drink, we do not say, “Oh, you’re so sloppy! What’s the matter with you?” But then why do we think such statements are appropriate for our children, who are much more important to us than the visitor? Surely it would be more appropriate to say to the child something like, “You’ve spilled your drink. Will you get some paper towels from the kitchen?”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall a client once saying to me, “My father talks to any busboy with more courtesy than he’s ever extended to me.” “Please” and “thank you” are words that acknowledge dignity—that of the speaker as well as the listener.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Parents need to be informed: “Be careful what you say to your children. They may agree with you.” Before calling a child “stupid” or “clumsy” or “bad” or “a disappointment,” consider the question, “Is this how I want my child to experience him or herself?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a child grows up in a home where everyone deals with everyone else with natural, good-natured courtesy, he or she learns principles that apply both to self and to others. Respect of self and others feels like the normal order of things—which, properly, it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fact that we love a child does not guarantee that respect will be automatic. Lapses of consciousness are always possible, no matter how loving our feelings. Once when my granddaughter Ashley was five I was whirling her around, laughing with her, and enjoying myself so much that I did not stop when she said, “I want to be put down now, Grandpa.” But I caught myself an instant later when she said solemnly, “Grandpa, you’re not listening to me.” “Sorry, sweetheart,” I answered, and obeyed.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Visibility</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Especially important for the nurturing of a child’s self-esteem is the experience of what I have called <em class="calibre23">psychological visibility</em>. I wrote about the human need for visibility, as it applies to all human relationships, in <em class="calibre23">The Psychology of Romantic Love</em>. Here I want to touch on just a few basics as they pertain to a child’s interactions with parents. But first, some general comments about visibility.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">If I say or do something and you respond in a way that I perceive as congruent in terms of my own behavior—if I become playful and you become playful in turn, or if I express joy and you show understanding of my state, or if I express sadness and you convey empathy, or if I do something I am proud of and you smile in admiration—I feel seen and understood by you. I feel visible. In contrast, if I say or do something and you respond in a way that makes no sense to me in terms of my own behavior—if I become playful and you react as if I were being hostile, or if I express joy and you display impatience and tell me not to be silly, or if I express sadness and you accuse me of pretending, or if I do something I am proud of and you react with condemnation—I do not feel seen and understood, I feel invisible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To feel visible to you I do not require your agreement with what I am saying. We might be having a philosophical or political discussion, and we might hold different viewpoints, but if we show understanding of what the other is saying, and if our responses are congruent in terms of that, we can continue to feel visible to each other and even, in the midst of arguing, be having a thoroughly good time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we feel visible, we feel that the other person and I are in the same reality, the same universe, metaphorically speaking. When we don’t, it is as if we were in different realities. But all satisfying human interactions require congruence at this level; if we do not experience ourselves as in the same reality, we cannot relate in a mutually satisfying way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The desire for visibility is the desire for a form of objectivity. I cannot perceive myself, cannot perceive my person, “objectively,” only internally, from a perspective that is uniquely private. But if your responses make sense in terms of my internal perceptions, you become a mirror allowing me the experience of objectivity about my person. I see myself reflected in your (appropriate) responses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Visibility is a matter of degree. From childhood on, we receive from human beings some measure of appropriate feedback; without it, we could not survive. Throughout our life there will be people whose responses will allow us to feel superficially visible and, if we are fortunate, a few people with whom we will feel visible in a more profound way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an aside, let me say that it is in romantic love, at its best, that psychological visibility tends to be most fully realized. Someone who loves us passionately is motivated to know and understand us to a greater depth than someone with whom our relationship is more casual. What does one often hear from people who are in love? “He (she) <em class="calibre23">understands</em> me as I have never felt understood before.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A child has a natural desire to be seen, heard, understood, and responded <a></a>to appropriately. To a self that is still forming, this need is particularly urgent. This is one of the reasons a child will look to a parent for a response after having taken some action. A child who experiences his or her excitement as good, as a value, but is punished or rebuked for it by adults undergoes a bewildering experience of invisibility and disorientation. A child who is praised for “always being an angel” and knows this is not true also experiences invisibility and disorientation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Working with adults in psychotherapy, I see the frequency with which the pain of invisibility in their home life as children is clearly central to their developmental problems and to their insecurities in adult relationships. Thus:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">If I had felt visible to my parents—</strong></p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t feel so alienated from people today.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt like a member of the human race.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt safe.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt visible to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt loved.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt there was hope.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt like one of the family.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt connected.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would be sane.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have been helped to understand myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt I had a home.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would have felt I belonged.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If a child says, unhappily, “I didn’t get the part in my school play,” and Mother answers, empathically, “That must hurt,” the child feels visible. What does a child feel if Mother answers sharply, “Do you think you’ll always get what you want in life?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a child bursts into the house, full of joy and excitement, and Mother says, smiling, “You’re happy today,” the child feels visible. What does a child feel if Mother screams, “Do you have to make so much noise? You’re so selfish and inconsiderate! What is the matter with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a child struggles to build a tree house in the backyard, and Father says, admiringly, “Even though it’s hard, you’re sticking with it,” the child feels visible. What does a child feel if Father says, impatiently, “God, can’t you do anything?”</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">If a child is out for a walk with Father and comments on a wide variety of things he sees along the way, and Father says, “You really notice a lot,” the child feels visible. What does a child feel if Father says, irritably, “Don’t you ever stop talking?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we convey love, appreciation, empathy, acceptance, respect, we make a child visible. When we convey indifference, scorn, condemnation, ridicule, we drive the child’s self into the lonely underground of invisibility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Psychologists and educators, reflecting on the childhood elements that support self-esteem, often speak of giving the child an appreciation of his or her uniqueness and also of giving the child a sense of affiliation or belonging (the sense of roots). Both goals are achieved to the extent that the child is given the experience of visibility.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">When we convey love, appreciation, empathy, acceptance, respect, we make a child visible</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Visibility should not be equated with praise. Watching a child struggle with a homework assignment and saying “Math seems hard for you” is not praise. Saying “You’re looking upset right now—want to talk?” is not praise. Saying “You wish you didn’t have to go to the dentist” is not praise. Saying “You really seem to enjoy chemistry” is not praise. But such statements do evoke the sense of being seen and understood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we are to love effectively—whether the object is our child, our mate, or a friend—the ability to provide the experience of visibility is essential. This presupposes the ability to see. And this presupposes the exercise of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in giving this to our child—visibility, consciousness—we model a practice that he or she may learn to emulate.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Age-Appropriate Nurturing</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">That children require nurturing is obvious. What is sometimes less obvious is the need for nurturing to be age-appropriate or, more precisely, appropriate to the child’s level of development.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some forms of nurturing that are right for a three-month-old infant would clearly be infantalizing for a six-year-old child. The infant is <a></a>dressed by an adult; a six-year-old properly dresses him or herself. Some forms of nurturing that are right for a six-year-old would subvert growth toward autonomy in a sixteen-year-old. When a six-year-old asks a question, it can be nurturing to take the question seriously and answer it. When a teenager asks a question it may be nurturing to draw out his or her own thoughts on the subject or recommend a book to read or a library to go to for research.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall a twenty-six-year-old woman who came to me in a state of crisis because her husband had left her <em class="calibre23">and she did not know how to shop for herself</em>. For the first nineteen years of life, her mother had purchased all her clothes; when she married at nineteen, her husband took over that responsibility—and not only for clothing but for all household goods, including food. Emotionally, she felt herself to be a child, with a child’s level of self-sufficiency. The thought of having to make independent choices and decisions, even about the simplest, most mundane matters, terrified her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a parent’s goal is to support the child’s independence, one of the ways this is achieved is to offer a child choices in keeping with the child’s level of development. A mother may not think it advisable to ask her five-year-old whether he or she wants to wear a sweater; but she can offer a choice of two sweaters. Some children are eager for an adult’s advice when it is not necessary. It is helpful to respond, “What do <em class="calibre23">you</em> think?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">One wants to turn over choice and decision making to a child as fast as the child can comfortably handle them. This is a judgment call, requiring consciousness and sensitivity from the adult. The point is: Be aware of the ultimate objective.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Praise and Criticism</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Loving parents, concerned to support the self-esteem of their children, may believe that the way to do it is with praise. But inappropriate praise can be as harmful to self-esteem as inappropriate criticism.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many years ago I learned from Haim Ginott an important distinction: that between evaluative praise and appreciative praise. It is evaluative praise that does not serve a child’s interests. Appreciative praise, in contrast, can be productive both in supporting self-esteem and in reinforcing desired behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To quote from Ginott’s <em class="calibre23">Teacher and Child:</em></p>
<a></a><div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      In psychotherapy a child is never told, “You are a good little boy.” “You are doing great.” “Carry on your good work.” Judgmental praise is avoided. Why? Because it is not helpful. It creates anxiety, invites dependency, and evokes defensiveness. It is not conducive to self-reliance, self-direction, and self-control. These qualities demand freedom from outside judgment. They require reliance on inner motivation and evaluation. To be himself, one needs to be free from the pressure of evaluative praise.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we state what we like and appreciate about the child’s actions and accomplishments, we remain factual and descriptive; we leave it to the child to do the evaluating. Ginott offers these examples of the process:</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Marcia, age twelve, helped the teacher rearrange the books in the class library. The teacher avoided personal praise. (“You did a good job. You are a hard worker. You are a good librarian.”) Instead she described what Marcia accomplished: “The books are all in order now. It’ll be easy for the children to find any book they want. It was a difficult job. But you did it. Thank you.” The teacher’s words of recognition allowed Marcia to make her own inference. “My teacher likes the job I did. I am a good worker.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">           Phyllis, age ten, wrote a poem describing her reaction to the first snow of the season. The teacher said, “Your poem reflected my own feelings; I was delighted to see my winter thoughts put into poetic phrases.” A smile crossed the little poet’s face. She turned to her friend and said, “Mrs. A. really <em class="calibre23">likes</em> my poem. She thinks I am terrific.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">           Ruben, age seven, had been struggling to make his handwriting neat. He found it difficult to keep his letters on the line. Finally, he managed to create a neat page with well-constructed letters. The teacher wrote on his paper: “The letters are neat. It was a pleasure to read your page.” When the papers were returned, the children eagerly read the notes the teacher had written. Suddenly, the teacher heard the smacking of lips. There was Ruben <em class="calibre23">kissing</em> his paper! “I am a good writer,” he announced.</p>
</div><div class="calibre42"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The more specifically targeted our praise, the more meaningful it is to the child. Praise that is generalized and abstract leaves the child wondering what exactly is being praised. It is not helpful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only does praise need to be specific, it needs to be commensurate <a></a>with its object. Overblown or grandiose praise tends to be overwhelming and anxiety provoking—because the child knows it does not match his or her self-perceptions (a problem that is avoided by descriptions of behavior, plus expressions of appreciation, that omit these unrealistic evaluations).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some parents are intent on helping their children’s self-esteem, but they praise globally, indiscriminately, and extravagantly. At best, this does not work. At worst, it backfires: the child feels invisible and anxious. In addition, this policy tends to produce “approval addicts”—children who cannot take a step without looking for praise and who feel disvalued if it is not forthcoming. Many devoted parents, with the best intentions in the world but without the appropriate skills, have turned their children into such approval addicts by saturating the home environment with their “loving” evaluations.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Inappropriate praise can be as harmful to self-esteem as inappropriate criticism</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If we wish to nurture autonomy, <em class="calibre23">always leave space for the child to make his or her own evaluations</em>, after we have described behavior. Leave the child free of the pressure of our judgments. Help create a context in which independent thinking can occur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we express our pleasure in and appreciation of a child’s questions or observations or thoughtfulness, we are encouraging the exercise of consciousness. When we respond positively and respectfully to a child’s efforts at self-expression, we encourage self-assertiveness. When we acknowledge and show appreciation for a child’s truthfulness, we encourage integrity. Catch a child doing something right and convey pleasure at the sight of it. Trust the child to draw the appropriate conclusions. That is the simplest statement of effective reinforcement.</p>
<p class="calibre24">As to criticism, it needs to be directed only at the child’s behavior, never at the child. The principle is: Describe the behavior (hitting a sibling, breaking a promise), describe your feelings about it (anger, disappointment), describe what you want done (if anything)—<em class="calibre23">and omit character assassination</em>.<a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_041.html#filepos914528" id="filepos519389"><sup class="calibre39">1</sup></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I speak of describing your feelings, I mean statements like “I feel <a></a>disappointed,” or “I feel dismayed,” or “I feel angry.” I do <em class="calibre23">not</em> mean statements like “I feel you are the most rotten kid who ever lived,” which is not a description of a feeling but of a thought, judgment, or evaluation concealed in the language of feeling. There is no such emotion as “You are the most rotten kid who ever lived.” The actual emotion here is rage and the desire to inflict pain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No good purpose is ever served by assaulting a child’s self-esteem. This is the first rule of effective criticism. We do not inspire better behavior by impugning a child’s worth, intelligence, morality, character, intentions, or psychology. No one was ever made “good” by being informed he or she was “bad.” (Nor by being told, “You’re just like [someone already viewed as reprehensible].”) Attacks on self-esteem tend to increase the likelihood that the unwanted behavior will happen again—“Since I am bad, I will behave badly.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">No one was ever made “good” by being informed he or she was “bad.”</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Many an adult in psychotherapy complains of still hearing the internalized voices of Mother or Father telling them they are “bad,” “rotten,” “stupid,” “worthless.” Often they struggle toward a better life against the gravitational pull of those abusive terms, fighting not to succumb to their parents’ dark view of them. They do not always succeed. Since self-concept tends to turn into destiny through the principle of self-fulfilling prophecies, we need to consider what self-concept we wish to promote.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we can rebuke without violating or demeaning a child’s dignity, if we can respect a child’s self-esteem even when we are angry, we have mastered one of the most challenging and important aspects of competent parenting.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Parental Expectations</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">I have already commented on Coopersmith’s findings with regard to parental expectations. It is no service to children to expect nothing of them. Rational parents uphold ethical standards to which they hold children accountable. They also uphold standards of performance: they <a></a>expect children to learn, master knowledge and skills, and move toward increasing maturity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such expectations need to be calibrated to the child’s level of development and be respectful of the child’s unique attributes. One does not overwhelm a child with expectations that take no cognizance of his or her context and needs. But neither does one assume that a child will always operate at a high level “naturally,” guided by sheer emotional impulse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Children clearly show a desire to know what is expected of them and do not feel secure when the answer is “nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Recommendations for Further Reading</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Of all the books written on the art of child-rearing, there are six that I personally found extraordinarily useful because of the wisdom and clarity they bring to the “nuts-and-bolts” problems of everyday family living. Although they rarely mention self-esteem as such, they are superb guidebooks to nurturing the self-esteem of the young. I mention them here because they develop so artfully and imaginatively the specifics of conveying love, acceptance, respect, and appropriate praise and criticism in the face of the countless challenges that children present to parents and other adults.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three of these books are by Haim Ginott: <em class="calibre23">Between Parent and Child, Between Parent and Teenager</em>, and <em class="calibre23">Teacher and Child.</em><a href="CR%21103EG31QYH2BV8VT2G4M9E0T9KCH_split_043.html#filepos921156" id="filepos524112"><sup class="calibre39">*</sup></a> The other three titles are by two former students of Ginott, Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish: <em class="calibre23">Liberated Parents, Liberated Children; How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk;</em> and <em class="calibre23">Siblings without Rivalry</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet another outstanding book is <em class="calibre23">Parent Effectiveness Training</em> by Dr. Thomas Gordon. One of its great merits is that it offers fairly detailed principles combined with specific skills and techniques for resolving a wide variety of child-parent conflicts. Gordon’s approach is largely congruent with that of Ginott, although there appear to be some differences. For one, Ginott insists that parents must in some circumstances set limits and rules; Gordon criticizes this idea and seems to argue that all conflicts should be resolved “democratically.” In this issue I side with Ginott, <a></a>although I am not certain how real this difference is, since Gordon would not allow a small child to play in the streets at his or her discretion. What both men share (along with Faber and Mazlish) is a passionate aversion to disciplining by physical punishment. I applaud this because I am convinced that fear of physical punishment is deadly for the growth of a child’s self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Dealing with Mistakes</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">How parents respond when children make mistakes can be fateful for self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A child learns to walk through a series of false moves. Gradually he or she eliminates the moves that don’t work and keeps the moves that do; making mistakes is integral to the process of learning to walk. Making mistakes is integral to a great deal of learning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If a child is chastised for making a mistake, or ridiculed, humiliated, or punished—or if the parent steps in impatiently and says, “Here, let me do it!”—he or she cannot feel free to struggle and learn. A natural process of growth is sabotaged. To avoid mistakes becomes a higher priority than to master new challenges.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A child who does not feel accepted by parents if he or she makes a mistake may learn to practice <em class="calibre23">self</em>-rejection in response to mistakes. Consciousness is muted, self-acceptance is undermined, self-responsibility and self-assertiveness are suppressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given the chance, children will usually learn from their mistakes naturally and spontaneously. Sometimes it can be useful to ask, noncritically and nonpedantically, “What did you learn? What might you do differently next time?”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Making mistakes is integral to a great deal of learning</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">It is more desirable to stimulate the search for answers than to provide answers. However, to think of stimulating the mind of the child usually requires a higher level of consciousness (and of patience) of the parent than does the practice of handing down ready-made solutions. Impatience is often the enemy of good parenting.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">Working with adults who received destructive messages about mistakes as children, I often use a series of sentence stems. Here are a typical sequence and typical endings:</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">When my mother saw me making a mistake—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre41">      She became impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      She conveyed that I was hopeless.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      She called me her big baby.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      She became angry and said, “Here, let me show you!”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      She laughed and looked contemptuous.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      She yelled for my father.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">When my father saw me making a mistake—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre41">      He got angry.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He gave a sermon.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He swore.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He compared me to my superior brother.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He launched into a half-hour lecture.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He talked about how brilliantly he did things.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He said, “You’re your mother’s son.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      He walked out of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">When I catch myself making a mistake—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre41">      I tell myself I’m stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I call myself a klutz.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I feel like a loser.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I feel frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wonder what will happen when I’m found out.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I tell myself it’s pointless to try.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I tell myself it’s unforgivable.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I feel self-contempt.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">If someone had told me it’s all right to make mistakes</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be a different person.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t make so many mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t be so afraid to try anything.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t be so self-critical.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be more open.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be more adventuresome.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d accomplish more.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">What I hear myself saying is</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’m doing everything to myself my mother and father once did to me.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      My parents are still inside my head.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I have no more compassion for myself than my father did.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I berate myself worse than Mother did.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      If I can’t make mistakes, I can’t grow.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’m stifling myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      My self-esteem is devastated by mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">If I had the courage to allow myself mistakes</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would not make as many mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be careful but more relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I could enjoy my work.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would take more chances with new ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d have more ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I could be more creative.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be happier.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would not be irresponsible.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">If I were more compassionate about my mistakes—</strong></p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t feel doomed and I would try harder.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I would give more.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d like myself more.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t be depressed.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      I would be more conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I wouldn’t struggle with all this fear.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I’d be my own man and not my parents’ little boy.</p>
<p class="calibre36"><strong class="calibre6">As I learn a better attitude toward making mistakes</strong>—</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will feel less tense.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      My work will improve.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I think I will try new things.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will have to say good-bye to an old script.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will become a better parent to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will find it hard.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will have to learn that it’s not self-indulgence.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I will have to practice.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      It will take getting used to.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I feel hopeful.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      I feel excited.</p>
<p class="calibre51">The last six stems listed above point to one of the ways we can begin to undo negative programming. In therapy or in my self-esteem groups I might ask a client to write six to ten endings for several of these last stems every day for two or three weeks—as a potent device of deprogramming. The principle is that we keep “radiating” the destructive ideas with highly concentrated awareness (which is very different from worrying or “stewing” or obsessing or complaining about them).</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Need for Sanity</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">There is perhaps nothing more important to know about children than that they need to make sense out of their experience. In effect, they need to know that the universe is rational—and that human existence is knowable, predictable, and stable. On that foundation, they can build a sense of efficacy; without it, the task is worse than difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Physical reality tends to be far more “reliable” than most human beings. Consequently, children who feel ineffective in the human realm often turn for a sense of power to nature or machinery or engineering or <a></a>physics or mathematics, all of which offer a degree of consistency and “sanity” rarely found among human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But “sanity” in family life is one of a child’s most urgent needs if healthy development is to be possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What does <em class="calibre23">sanity</em> mean in this context? It means adults who, for the most part, say what they mean and mean what they say. It means rules that are understandable, consistent, and fair. It means not being punished today for behavior that was ignored or even rewarded yesterday. It means being brought up by parents whose emotional life is more or less graspable and predictable—in contrast to an emotional life punctuated by bouts of anxiety or rage or euphoria unrelated to any discernible cause or pattern. It means a home in which reality is appropriately acknowledged—in contrast to a home in which, for instance, a drunken father misses the chair he meant to sit on and crashes to the floor while Mother goes on eating and talking as though nothing had happened. It means parents who practice what they preach. Who are willing to admit when they make mistakes and apologize when they know they have been unfair or unreasonable. Who appeal to a child’s wish to understand rather than the wish to avoid pain. Who reward and reinforce consciousness in a child rather than discourage and penalize it.</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">There is perhaps nothing more important to know about children than that they need to make sense out of their experience</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">If, instead of obedience, we want cooperation from our children; if, instead of conformity, we want self-responsibility—we can achieve it in a home environment that supports the child’s <em class="calibre23">mind</em>. We cannot achieve it in an environment intrinsically hostile to the exercise of mind.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">The Need for Structure</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Children’s security and growth needs are in part met by the presence of an appropriate structure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Structure” pertains to the rules, implicit or explicit, operative in a family, rules about what is or is not acceptable and permissible, what is expected, how various kinds of behavior are dealt with, who is free to do <a></a>what, how decisions affecting family members are made, and what kind of values are upheld.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A good structure is one that respects the needs, individuality, and intelligence of each family member. Open communication is highly valued. Such a structure is flexible rather than rigid, open and discussible rather than closed and authoritarian. In such a structure, parents offer explanations, not commandments. They appeal to confidence rather than to fear. They encourage self-expression. They uphold the kind of values we associate with individuality and autonomy. Their standards inspire rather than intimidate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Children do not desire unlimited “freedom.” Most children feel safer and more secure in a structure that is somewhat authoritarian than in no structure at all. Children need limits and feel anxious in their absence. This is one of the reasons they test limits—to be certain they are there. They need to know that <em class="calibre23">someone is flying the plane</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Overly “permissive” parents tend to produce highly anxious children. By this I mean parents who back away from any leadership role; who treat all family members as equal not only in dignity but also in knowledge and authority; and who strive to teach no values and uphold no standards for fear of “imposing” their “biases” on their children. A client once said to me, “My mother would have thought it ‘undemocratic’ to tell me that getting pregnant at the age of thirteen is not a good idea. Do you know how terrifying it is to grow up in a house where no one acts like they know what’s true or right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When children are offered rational values and standards, self-esteem is nurtured. When they are not, self-esteem is starved.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">A Family Dinner</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">With both parents working, sometimes long hours, it is often difficult for parents to spend with children all the time they would like. Sometimes parents and children do not even take meals together. Without entering into all the complexities of this issue and all the problematic aspects of contemporary life-styles, I want to mention one simple suggestion that clients of mine have found helpful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask parents who consult me to make a commitment to have at least one major family dinner a week at which all members are present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask that dinner be slow and leisurely and that everyone be invited to talk about his or her activities and concerns. No lectures, no sermons, no <a></a>patronizing, just sharing of experiences, everyone treated with love and respect. The theme is self-expression and self-disclosure—and the sustaining of connections.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many parents who agree with the project in principle find they need considerable discipline in its execution. The urge to condescend, patronize, pontificate, can be powerful. They can stifle self-expression even while “demanding” it. If, however, they can overcome the impulse to be “authorities,” if they can express thoughts and feelings simply and naturally with their children and invite the same self-expression in return, they offer a profound psychological gift to their children and to themselves. They help create a sense of “belonging” in the best sense of that word—that is, they create a sense of <em class="calibre23">family</em>. They create an environment in which self-esteem can grow.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Child Abuse</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">When we think of child abuse we think of children who are physically abused or sexually molested. That such abuse can be catastrophic for a child’s self-esteem is widely recognized. It evokes the experience of traumatic powerlessness, the feeling of nonownership of one’s own body, and a sense of agonizing defenselessness that can last a lifetime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, a more comprehensive examination of what constitutes child abuse would have to include the following items, all of which throw up severe obstacles to the growth of a child’s self-esteem. Parents perpetrate child abuse when they…</p>
<div class="calibre40">
<p class="calibre41">      Convey that the child is not “enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Chastise the child for expressing “unacceptable” feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Ridicule or humiliate the child.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Convey that the child’s thoughts or feelings have no value or importance.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Attempt to control the child by shame or guilt.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Overprotect the child and consequently obstruct normal learning and increasing self-reliance.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Underprotect the child and consequently obstruct normal ego development.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre41">      Raise a child with no rules at all, and thus no supporting structure; or else rules that are contradictory, bewildering, undiscussable, and oppressive—in either case inhibiting normal growth.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Deny a child’s perception of reality and implicitly encourage the child to doubt his or her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Terrorize a child with physical violence or the threat of it, thus instilling acute fear as an enduring characteristic at the child’s core.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Treat a child as a sexual object.</p>
<p class="calibre41">      Teach that the child is bad, unworthy, or sinful by nature.</p>

<p class="calibre2">When a child’s basic needs are frustrated, as they invariably are when subjected to the above treatment, the result is acute pain. Often embedded in that pain is the feeling: <em class="calibre23">Something is wrong with me. Somehow I am defective</em>. And the tragedy of a destructive self-fulfilling prophecy is set in motion.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Urgent Issues</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">As I said earlier, my goal in this chapter has not been to offer a course on child-rearing. My goal has been to isolate certain issues that my experience as a psychotherapist has taught me are often fateful for a young person’s self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we listen to the stories of adults in therapy, noting the historical circumstances under which tragic decisions were sometimes made, it is not difficult to see what was missing and needed during the childhood years. By extrapolating from wounds, as it were, we can deepen our understanding of what prevents wounds from occurring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over two decades ago, in <em class="calibre23">Breaking Free</em>, I published a list of questions I used in psychotherapy to facilitate explorations into the childhood origins of poor self-esteem. I include here a revised and slightly expanded version of that list, as a kind of summing up of some, although not all, of the issues we have been addressing. They can be useful stimulants to self-examination for individuals as well as evocative guides for parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">1</strong>. When you were a child, did your parents’ manner of behaving and of dealing with you give you the impression that you were living in a world that was rational, predictable, intelligible? Or a world that was <a></a>contradictory, bewildering, unknowable? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">In your home, did you have the sense the evident facts were acknowledged and respected or avoided and denied?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">2</strong>. Were you taught the importance of learning to think and of cultivating your intelligence? Did your parents provide you with intellectual stimulation and convey the idea that the use of your mind can be an exciting adventure? Did anything in your home life suggest such a perspective, if only implicitly? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Was consciousness valued?</em></strong></p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged toward obedience or toward self-responsibility?</em></strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">3</strong>. Were you encouraged to think independently, to develop your critical faculty? Or were you encouraged to be obedient rather than mentally active and questioning? (Supplementary questions: Did your parents project that it was more important to conform to what other people believed than to discover what is true? When your parents wanted you to do something, did they appeal to your understanding and give you reasons, when possible and appropriate, for their request? Or did they communicate, in effect, “Do it because I say so?”) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged toward obedience or toward self-responsibility?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">4</strong>. Did you feel free to express your views openly, without fear of punishment? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were self-expression and self-assertiveness safe?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">5</strong>. Did your parents communicate their disapproval of your thoughts, desires, or behavior by means of humor, teasing, or sarcasm? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you taught to associate self-expression with humiliation?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">6</strong>. Did your parents treat you with respect? (Supplementary questions: Were your thoughts, needs, and feelings given consideration? Was your dignity as a human being acknowledged? When you expressed ideas or opinions, were they taken seriously? Were your likes and dislikes, whether or not they were acceded to, treated with respect? Were your desires responded to thoughtfully and, again, with respect?) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you implicitly encouraged to respect yourself, to take your thoughts seriously, to take the exercise of your mind seriously?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">7</strong>. Did you feel that you were psychologically visible to your parents, seen and understood? Did you feel real to them? (Supplementary questions: Did your parents seem to make a genuine effort to understand you? Did your parents seem authentically interested in you as a person? Could <a></a>you talk to your parents about issues of importance and receive concerned, meaningful understanding from them?) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Was there congruence between your sense of who you were and the sense of who you were conveyed by your parents?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">8</strong>. Did you feel loved and valued by your parents, in the sense that you experienced yourself as a source of pleasure to them? Or did you feel unwanted, perhaps a burden? Did you feel hated? Or did you feel that you were simply an object of indifference? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you implicitly encouraged to experience yourself as lovable?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">9</strong>. Did your parents deal with you fairly and justly? (Supplementary questions: Did your parents resort to threats to control your behavior—either threats of immediate punitive action on their part, threats in terms of long-range consequences for your life, or threats of supernatural punishments, such as going to hell? Were you appreciated when you did well, or merely criticized when you did badly? Were your parents willing to admit it when they were wrong? Or was it against their policy to concede that they were wrong?) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Did you feel yourself to be living in a rational, just, and “sane” environment?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">10</strong>. Was it your parents’ practice to punish you or discipline you by striking or beating you? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Was fear or terror intentionally evoked in you as a means of manipulation and control?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">11</strong>. Did your parents project that they believed in your basic competence and goodness? Or that they saw you as disappointing, ineffectual, worthless, or bad? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Did you feel that your parents were on your side, supporting the best within you?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">12</strong>. Did your parents convey the sense that they believed in your intellectual and creative potentialities? Or did they project that they saw you as mediocre or stupid or inadequate? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Did you feel that your mind and abilities were appreciated?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">13</strong>. In your parents’ expectations concerning your behavior and performance, did they take cognizance of your knowledge; needs, interests, and circumstances? Or were you confronted with expectations and demands that were overwhelming and beyond your ability to satisfy? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged to treat your wants and needs as important?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">14</strong>. Did your parents’ behavior and manner of dealing with you tend to produce guilt in you? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you implicitly (or explicitly) encouraged to see yourself as bad?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">15</strong>. Did your parents’ behavior and manner of dealing with you tend to produce fear in you? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged to think, not in terms of <a></a>gaining values or satisfaction, but in terms of avoiding pain or disapproval?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">16</strong>. Did your parents respect your intellectual and physical privacy? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were your dignity and rights respected?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">17</strong>. Did your parents project that it was desirable for you to think well of yourself—in effect, to have self-esteem? Or were you cautioned against valuing yourself, encouraged to be “humble”? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Was self-esteem a value in your home?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">18</strong>. Did your parents convey that what a person made of his or her life and what you, specifically, made of your life, was important? (Supplementary questions: Did your parents project that great things are possible for human beings, and specifically that great things were possible for you? Did your parents give you the impression that life could be exciting, challenging, a rewarding adventure?) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you offered an uplifting vision of what was possible in life?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">19</strong>. Did your parents instill in you a fear of the world, a fear of other people? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you given the sense that the world is a malevolent place?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">20</strong>. Were you urged to be open in the expression of your emotions and desires? Or were your parents’ behavior and manner of treating you such as to make you fear emotional self-assertiveness and openness or to regard it as inappropriate? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were emotional honesty, self-expression, and self-acceptance supported?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">21</strong>. Were your mistakes accepted as a normal part of the learning process? Or as something you were taught to associate with contempt, ridicule, punishment? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged in a fear-free approach to new challenges and new learning?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">22</strong>. Did your parents encourage you in the direction of having a healthy, affirmative attitude toward sex and toward your own body? A negative attitude? Or did they treat the entire subject as nonexistent? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Did you feel supported in a happy and positive attitude toward your physical being and evolving sexuality?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">23</strong>. Did your parents’ manner of dealing with you tend to develop and strengthen your sense of your masculinity or femininity? Or to frustrate and diminish it? <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">If you were male, did your parents convey that that was desirable? If you were female, did they convey that that was desirable?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre6">24</strong>. Did your parents encourage you to feel that your life belonged to you? Or were you encouraged to believe that you were merely a family asset and that your achievements were significant only insofar as they <a></a>brought glory to your parents? (Supplementary question: Were you treated as a family resource, or as an end in yourself?) <strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">Were you encouraged to understand that you are not here on earth to live up to someone else’s expectations?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Strategic Detachment</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">Many children undergo experiences that place enormous obstacles in the way of the development of self-esteem. Everyone knows this. A child may find the world of parents and other adults incomprehensible and threatening. The self is not nurtured but attacked. The will to be conscious and efficacious is assaulted. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to understand adult policies, statements, and behavior, many children give up—and take the blame for their feelings of helplessness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Often they sense, miserably, desperately, and inarticulately, that something is terribly wrong—with their elders, or with themselves, or with <em class="calibre23">something</em>. What they often come to feel is: “I’ll never understand other people. I’ll never be able to do what they expect of me. I don’t know what’s right or wrong, and I’m never going to know.”</p>
<div class="calibre29"> </div><hr class="calibre37"/><p class="calibre38"><strong class="calibre6"><em class="calibre23">To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness</em>.</strong></p>
<hr class="calibre37"/><div class="calibre29"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">The heroic child who continues to struggle to make sense out of the world and the people in it, however, is developing a powerful source of strength, no matter what the anguish or bewilderment experienced along the way. Caught in a particularly cruel, frustrating, and irrational environment, he or she will doubtless feel alienated from many of the people in the immediately surrounding world, and legitimately so. But the child will not feel alienated from reality, will not feel, at the deepest level, incompetent to live—or at least he or she has a decent chance to avoid that fate. To persevere with the will to understand in the face of obstacles is the heroism of consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Often children who survive extremely adverse childhoods have learned a particular survival strategy. I call it “strategic detachment.” This is not the withdrawal from reality that leads to psychological disturbance, but an intuitively calibrated <em class="calibre23">disengagement</em> from noxious <a></a>aspects of their family life or other aspects of their world. They somehow know, <em class="calibre23">This is not all there is</em>. They hold the belief that a better alternative exists <em class="calibre23">somewhere</em> and that <em class="calibre23">someday they will find their way to it</em>. They persevere in that idea. They somehow know <em class="calibre23">Mother is not all women, Father is not all men, this family does not exhaust the possibilities of human relationships</em>—<em class="calibre23">there is life beyond this neighborhood</em>. This does not spare them suffering in the present, but it allows them not to be destroyed by it. Their strategic detachment does not guarantee that they will never know feelings of powerlessness, but it helps them not to be stuck there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We admire such children. But as parents we would like to offer our own children happier options.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><span class="calibre5"><span class="calibre6">     <strong class="calibre6">Parenting as a Vehicle of Personal Evolution</strong></span></span></p><div class="calibre34"> </div>
<p class="calibre2">In an earlier chapter I outlined the key ideas or beliefs most consequential for self-esteem. It follows that a family in which these ideas are communicated, as well as exemplified in the adult’s practice, is one in which children’s self-esteem is nurtured. A child who grows up in this philosophical context has an enormous developmental advantage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, ideas and values are most powerfully communicated when they are embedded into family life, rooted in the being of the parents. Regardless of what we think we’re teaching, we teach what we are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This fact can be turned around and looked at from another perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Almost any important task can be used as a vehicle for personal development. Work can be a path for personal growth and development; so can marriage; so can child-rearing. We can choose to make any of them a spiritual discipline—a discipline in the service of our own evolution. We can take the principles that build self-esteem and use our work as an arena in which to apply them—with the result that both performance and self-esteem will rise. We can take the same principles and apply them in our marriage—with the result that the relationship will flourish (other things being equal) and self-esteem will rise. We can take the principles that raise self-esteem in ourselves, and apply them to our interactions with our children.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We need not pretend to our children that we are “perfect.” We can acknowledge our struggles and admit our mistakes. The likelihood is that the self-esteem of everyone in the family will benefit.</p>
<a></a>
<p class="calibre2">If we choose to bring a (5 percent!) higher level of consciousness to dealings with our children—to what we say and how we respond—what might we do differently?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we choose to bring a higher level of self-acceptance to our life, what might we convey to our children about self-acceptance?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we choose to bring a higher level of self-responsibility to our parenting (rather than always blaming our mate or our children), what example might we set?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we are more self-assertive, more authentic, what might our children learn about being genuine?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we operate at a higher level of purposefulness, what might our children learn about goal achievement and an active orientation toward life?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we bring a higher level of integrity to the task of parenting, in what ways might our children benefit?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And if we do all of this, in what ways might <em class="calibre23">we</em> benefit?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The answer to this last is simple: In supporting and nurturing the self-esteem of our children, we support and nurture our own.</p>
